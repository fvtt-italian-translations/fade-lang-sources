Only fighters of Name level or higher are eligible. Once accepted, the avenger is bound to serve the order and may be summoned by its leaders at any time to perform tasks that align with the powers of Evil.</p></li><li><p><strong>Detect Evil</strong>: A avenger can detect evil, as per the cleric spell, once per round by concentrating. This ability has a range of 120 feet but cannot be used in the same round as an attack.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cleric Spells</strong>: A avenger with a Wisdom score of 13 or higher can cast cleric spells as if they were a cleric of one-third their actual level, rounded down. For example:</p><ul><li>At 9th level, the paladin can cast spells as a 3rd-level cleric.</li><li>At 17th level, the paladin can cast spells as a 5th-level cleric.</li></ul></li><li>Fighters with Wisdom scores of 12 or less can still become avengers but cannot cast spells.

The avenger can also pose as a knight to seek Sanctuary from other rulers. If they successfully fool the ruler (and evade any magic that reveals alignment), the ruler will offer them standard Sanctuary.</p></li></ol><hr><p></p><h3>Paladin / Avenger Turn Undead Table</h3><div style=\"padding:4px;\"><table style=\"border-style:none;

      "description": "<h2>The Bard: Keeper of Legends, Master of Song</h2><p>From the dawn of history, bards have roamed the world as keepers of lore, song, and heroism. They are the wandering minstrels, the poetic warriors, the storytellers whose words shape the deeds of kings and heroes alike. Bards are more than mere entertainers—they are the voice of history, the heart of culture, and, when needed, an inspiration on the battlefield.</p><p>Unlike the common thief-turned-minstrel, a true Bard has honed both the martial and mystical aspects of their craft. They wield the power of <em>spell-songs</em>, enchanting allies and bewitching foes with melodies imbued with arcane energy. These spell-songs, much like the incantations of wizards or the prayers of clerics, draw upon an ancient tradition that blends magic with performance. Through song and instrument, they can heal wounds, bolster courage, cloud minds, or even weave illusions so vivid they seem real.</p><p>Though bards may fight alongside warriors and thieves, their true strength lies in their ability to influence the world with words, music, and guile. They are welcome in the courts of kings as much as in the taverns of common folk, gathering news, uncovering secrets, and spreading the tales of legends—sometimes their own.</p><p>Each bard carries an enchanted instrument, a tool of their trade that is as vital as a wizard’s spellbook. Without it, their magic is silent. Some are gifted such instruments by mentors, while others must quest to find their own. A bard’s skill with an instrument is as much a part of their identity as the songs they know, and a seasoned bard can earn a fortune simply by performing for the right audience.</p><p>Whether they choose to settle and establish a great conservatory to pass their wisdom on to students, or continue their travels as a lone wanderer chronicling the stories of the world, all bards share a common purpose: to ensure that no great deed goes unsung, no legend is forgotten, and no soul is left without a melody to guide them.</p><p><em>Adapted from Geoff Gander and Marco Dalmonte’s article at </em><a href=\"https://pandius.com/bardclas.html\"><em>Pandius</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3>Key Characteristics</h3><h4>Prime Requisite</h4><p>Dexterity and Charisma. A Bard gains a 5% experience bonus if both Dexterity and Charisma are 13–15, and a 10% bonus if both are 16 or higher.</p><h4>Combat Skills</h4><ul><li>Bards may use <strong>any one-handed melee weapon and all missile weapons</strong>.</li><li>They <strong>cannot use two-handed weapons</strong>, as these interfere with playing instruments.</li><li>Bards may wear <strong>armor up to chain mail</strong>, but heavier armor imposes penalties on their Thief skills.</li><li>A Bard may wield <strong>shields of medium size or smaller</strong>, but doing so prevents playing an instrument.</li></ul><h4>Hit Dice</h4><ul><li>Bards roll <strong>1d6 for hit points per level</strong> until 9th level, after which they gain <strong>+2 hit points per level</strong>. Constitution adjustments no longer apply at this point.</li></ul><h4>Special Abilities</h4><p>Bards possess several skills similar to Thieves, along with unique abilities that set them apart.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Thief Abilities</strong> (affected by armor type):</p><table border=\"1\"><thead><tr><th>Armor Type</th><th>Hide in Shadows</th><th>Move Silently</th><th>Hear Noise</th><th>Climb Walls</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Leather Armor</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Scale Mail</td><td>-5%</td><td>-15%</td><td>-5%</td><td>-15%</td></tr><tr><td>Chain Mail</td><td>-10%</td><td>-20%*</td><td>-10%</td><td>-20%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>*This penalty may be halved if wearing Elven Chain Mail.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Read Languages:</strong> At <strong>4th level</strong>, a Bard can read non-magical languages with an <strong>80% chance</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Magic Scrolls:</strong> At <strong>10th level</strong>, a Bard can attempt to use magic-user scrolls, with a <strong>10% chance of backfire</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bardic Charm:</strong> At <strong>3rd level</strong>, a Bard gains the ability to <strong>charm others</strong> through song or poetry (similar to <em>charm person</em>). This improves at higher levels to affect intelligent monsters and, later, even plants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spell-Songs:</strong> Bards can cast <strong>spell-songs</strong>, a unique form of magic that functions similarly to spells but requires performance and an enchanted instrument.</p></li><li><p><strong>Backstab (Modified):</strong></p><ul><li>When striking an <strong>unaware opponent</strong>, a Bard gains <strong>+2 to attack rolls</strong> and deals <strong>1.5x damage</strong> (round down).</li><li>This allows for precision strikes without the raw lethality of a Thief’s backstab.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Advancement at Name Level (9th Level)</h3><p>At 9th level, a Bard earns renown and may establish a <strong>Conservatory</strong>, a place dedicated to training apprentices, preserving history, and refining spell-songs. This Conservatory attracts <strong>1d8 1st-level apprentice Bards</strong>, eager to learn from a master of the craft. These apprentices are loyal and dedicated students, though they will not follow the Bard into direct danger.</p><p>A Conservatory serves as a center of culture, storytelling, and music, drawing the attention of nobles, scholars, and fellow adventurers. It may take many forms—a grand hall in a city, a secluded retreat in the mountains, or a hidden sanctuary where lost songs and stories are recovered. The Bard may use this stronghold to research new spell-songs, store historical knowledge, and influence the world through their art.</p><h3>Stronghold Options</h3><p>Bards who choose to establish a Conservatory are expected to offer shelter and hospitality to traveling Bards who seek knowledge or rest. In exchange, these visitors bring news, songs, and secrets from across the land. The Conservatory may gain influential patrons, such as kings or powerful wizards, who see value in the Bard’s wisdom and the knowledge housed within.</p><p>Not all Bards settle in one place. Some prefer to <strong>remain travelers</strong>, continuing their journey as wandering minstrels, historians, and adventurers. These Traveling Bards have a unique connection to the world’s hidden stories. Once per month, they may <strong>learn of an unsung epic</strong>, a forgotten tale, or a legendary figure whose story has yet to be told. This knowledge can lead to lost treasures, rare spell-songs, or even legendary quests.</p><p>While a Bard may choose the life of a wanderer, they are always welcome at the Conservatories of their peers. These sanctuaries provide a place to rest, study, and exchange knowledge, ensuring that no great deed or legend is forgotten.</p>",

The warrior has AC 0 and a Dexterity of 13. The character has a Strength of 16 and wields a +2 sword, giving them a +4 to attack rolls. Their Dexterity is 12, with no bonus. The character needs a 7 to hit AC 0. They roll a 6, adding their +4 bonus to make a total of 10, successfully hitting the warrior.</p><p>The warrior then rolls 1d20 and gets a 15. Subtracting their Dexterity bonus of +1 (from their Dexterity of 13) results in 14. Since the character has no Dexterity bonus, the final roll remains 14, which is greater than the warrior’s Dexterity score of 13. The disarm attempt succeeds.</p><p>Once disarmed, the opponent can either switch weapons, losing initiative for the next round, or attempt to retrieve the dropped weapon. To retrieve it, the opponent must retreat and pick up the weapon.</p>",

The DM will determine if the cleric's order has the authority to grant land based on the campaign's setting.</p><p>If the cleric has a clean record, his order may assist with construction costs, typically covering up to 50% of the expenses. The player can design the stronghold, and the DM will assess the costs, deciding what portion the order will fund. Regardless of the financial support, the stronghold remains the cleric's property, and he cannot deny access to order members, nor can he be reassigned against his will.</p><p>Once the stronghold is built, a number of lower-level clerics (typically 1d6) will arrive to assist with its clerical functions.

For example:</p><ul><li>At 9th level, the paladin turns undead as a 3rd-level cleric.</li><li>At 16th or 17th level, the paladin turns undead as a 5th-level cleric.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Hireling Limit</strong>: The paladin can be accompanied by a number of hirelings equal to or less than their effective clerical level. For example, a paladin with the abilities of a 5th-level cleric may travel with up to five hirelings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assisting Others</strong>: A paladin must provide aid to anyone who requests it, except in the following cases:</p><ul><li>The paladin is not obligated to assist evil individuals or support evil goals.</li><li>If engaged in a mission for a higher authority (such as a quest or serving a noble), the paladin may offer limited help, such as advice or temporary shelter, and must explain their inability to provide further assistance. Aid is limited to services and does not include monetary or material donations.</li></ul></li></ol><hr><p></p><h3>Paladin Turn Undead Table</h3><div style=\"padding:4px;\"><table style=\"border-style:none;

The wording is critically important, as the wish will usually follow the literal meaning of the words spoken—regardless of the caster's intentions.</p><p>The DM is responsible for maintaining game balance. Poorly worded wishes may have unintended consequences, while selfish or greedy wishes may be deliberately twisted by the DM. If a wish is unreasonable, the DM may simply rule that it has no effect.</p><h4>Examples of Faulty Wishes:</h4><ul><li>\"I wish that I knew everything about this dungeon.\" - The character gains full knowledge for a moment but then immediately forgets everything.</li><li>\"I wish for a million gold pieces.\" - The gold pieces may appear, but they might land on the caster (crushing them) and then vanish.</li><li>\"I wish to permanently gain the gaze power of a basilisk while retaining all my abilities.\" - This could result in the caster growing an additional basilisk head.</li></ul><h4>Wish Limitations & Effects:</h4><ul><li>A wish cannot be used to gain experience points or levels.</li><li>A properly worded wish can substitute for any magic-user spell of 8th level or lower or any clerical or druidic spell of 6th level or lower at the DM’s discretion.</li><li>If the wish is used to harm a creature, the target may make a saving throw vs. spells. If successful, the effect is halved, and the other half rebounds on the caster (who may save with a -4 penalty).</li><li>If the wish is used to inconvenience rather than harm (such as teleporting a victim into a prison cell), no saving throw is allowed.</li></ul><h4>Special Uses of a Wish:</h4><ul><li>A wish can create treasure, up to 50,000 gold pieces. However, the caster loses 1 XP per gold piece gained, and this loss cannot be restored.</li><li>A wish can temporarily change one ability score to a minimum of 3 or maximum of 18, lasting six turns.</li><li>Permanent ability score increases require casting a number of wishes equal to the desired score (e.g., raising Strength from 15 to 16 requires 16 wishes within one week).</li><li>Wishes cannot permanently lower ability scores.</li></ul><h4>Racial & Class Effects:</h4><ul><li>A wish cannot raise a human character beyond 36th level, but it can grant a demihuman one additional Hit Die (maximum HD: Halflings 9, Elves 11, Dwarves 13).</li><li>A wish can change a demihuman to a human (or vice versa), allowing them to advance as a new class at the same level.</li><li>If a wish is used to change another character’s class, the target may make a saving throw vs. spells with a +5 bonus to resist.</li></ul><h4>Altering Past Events:</h4><p>A wish can alter events from the past 24 hours. However, it cannot fully overturn impossible odds. Examples include:</p><ul><li>A lost battle may be changed into a less severe defeat.</li><li>A character’s death could instead become a near-death experience.</li><li>A permanent loss may be converted into a temporary one.</li></ul><h4>Important Note:</h4><p>If an effect is stated to be unchangeable \"even with a wish\", this limitation overrides the spell’s normal capabilities.</p><h4>Game Balance & DM Discretion:</h4><p>The DM must ensure that wishes remain within reason. A wish cannot alter fundamental game mechanics (such as preventing dragons from using their breath weapons). The more unreasonable a wish is, the less likely it is to succeed as intended.</p>",
