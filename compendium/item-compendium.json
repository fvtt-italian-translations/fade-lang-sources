Only fighters of Name level or higher are eligible. Once accepted, the avenger is bound to serve the order and may be summoned by its leaders at any time to perform tasks that align with the powers of Evil.</p></li><li><p><strong>Detect Evil</strong>: A avenger can detect evil, as per the cleric spell, once per round by concentrating. This ability has a range of 120 feet but cannot be used in the same round as an attack.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cleric Spells</strong>: A avenger with a Wisdom score of 13 or higher can cast cleric spells as if they were a cleric of one-third their actual level, rounded down. For example:</p><ul><li>At 9th level, the paladin can cast spells as a 3rd-level cleric.</li><li>At 17th level, the paladin can cast spells as a 5th-level cleric.</li></ul></li><li>Fighters with Wisdom scores of 12 or less can still become avengers but cannot cast spells. Avengers are trained in meditation and spellcasting by the clerics of their order, who provide this service without accepting compensation.</li><li><p><strong>Turn Undead</strong>: Avengers can turn undead with the same ability as a cleric of one-third their actual level, rounded down. For example:</p><ul><li>At 9th level, the avenger turns undead as a 3rd-level cleric.</li><li>At 16th or 17th level, the avenger turns undead as a 5th-level cleric.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Hireling Limit</strong>: An avenger is prohibited from having human or demihuman hirelings. However, they are allowed to try and persuade Chaotic monsters to become their hirelings.</p><ul><li><p>If a Chaotic creature is not immediately hostile, the avenger can offer food or treasure, signaling friendship through words or gestures.</p></li><li><p>If this approach fails, using threats or engaging in combat and achieving surrender might work similarly.</p></li><li><p>If the creature's Reaction roll results in friendship, it is convinced to follow and obey the avenger. This effect lasts as long as a charm spell cast by a magic-user; once it ends, it cannot be renewed.</p></li><li><p>The avenger can have as many Chaotic monster hirelings as their Charisma score permits; once one is lost, they may attempt to persuade another.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Requesting Sanctuary</strong>:</p><p>An avenger may approach any castle, ruin, or dungeon overseen by an intelligent Chaotic creature or individual, and using their alignment language, request Sanctuary (see knight, above). The avenger can also pose as a knight to seek Sanctuary from other rulers. If they successfully fool the ruler (and evade any magic that reveals alignment), the ruler will offer them standard Sanctuary.</p></li></ol><hr><p></p><h3>Paladin / Avenger Turn Undead Table</h3><div style=\"padding:4px;\"><table style=\"border-style:none;

They are among the most versatile and powerful classes but are physically fragile and limited in combat abilities. Their focus on magic allows them to wield extraordinary power as they gain experience.</p><h3>Key Characteristics:</h3><ul><li><strong>Prime Requisite</strong>: Intelligence, granting an experience bonus for high scores (5% for 13–15, 10% for 16–18).</li><li><strong>Combat Skills</strong>: Magic-users cannot wear armor or use shields and are restricted to using daggers. At the DM's discretion, other light weapons such as staves or slings may be permitted.</li><li><strong>Hit Dice</strong>: They use a d4 for hit points per level up to 9th level. Beyond that, they gain a fixed 1 hit point per level without Constitution bonuses.</li><li><strong>Spellcasting</strong>: Magic-users learn and prepare spells from a spellbook. Their magic includes a wide range of effects, such as attack spells (e.g., Fireball), utility spells (e.g., Knock), and defensive spells (e.g., Shield).</li></ul><h3>Advancement:</h3><ul><li>At <strong>9th level</strong> (Name level), a magic-user becomes a \"Wizard\" (male) or \"Maga\" (female). Wizards can create magic items, such as scrolls or potions.</li><li>Magic-users may construct a tower as a personal stronghold. Once completed, the tower attracts 1d6 apprentices (1st–3rd level magic-users), who serve the wizard as students and assistants.</li><li>If a dungeon is built beneath or near the tower and left unguarded, it may attract monsters. Some wizards encourage this to create a ready source of material for research and training.</li></ul><h3>Stronghold Options:</h3><ul><li><strong>Independent Wizards</strong>: Magic-users building their own towers typically do so without seeking approval from local rulers. However, gaining the ruler's favor might result in gifts or an official title to the land.</li><li><strong>Magists</strong>: Magic-users can serve as court wizards, known as Magists, advising rulers on magical matters in exchange for room, board, and a stipend (usually 3,000 gp per month or more). This arrangement allows continued magical research, often funded by the ruler.</li></ul><p>Magic-users begin their careers as fragile and vulnerable adventurers but grow into formidable spellcasters capable of altering the course of campaigns with their arcane abilities.

      "description": "<p>A net is an open weave of rope or cord that serves as a versatile tool and weapon. Small nets, measuring up to 10' x 10', are commonly used in hunting and adventuring. They can function as either hand-to-hand or thrown weapons. The encumbrance of a net depends on its size. Widely available in most campaign settings, nets are inexpensive but easily damaged. They are one of humanity’s earliest tools, used since prehistoric times, and are popular among humanoid monsters for hunting and defense.</p><p>Nets are only effective against creatures with a solid form. They do not work on wraiths, spectres, ethereal beings, or creatures made of water, like water elementals. While nets cause no physical damage, they can entangle, slow, or delay a target. To ensnare a target, the wielder must succeed on a normal attack roll. If successful, the target must then make a saving throw vs. death ray, potentially with bonuses from the Weapon Special Effects Table. A successful save negates the effect, and the net falls away harmlessly. Failure results in one of several effects depending on the target's size or experience.</p><p>An entangled victim may attempt a saving throw each round during the hand-to-hand combat phase to free themselves. Success indicates the net has been removed. If the target has a dagger (but not a longer or non-bladed weapon) in hand when ensnared, they gain a +4 bonus to their saving throw. If successful, the dagger cuts through and destroys the net.</p><h3>Net and Target Size:</h3><p>Nets are sized to correspond with the dimensions of their intended targets. Targets larger than the net gain bonuses to their saving throw based on the difference in size. For each size category larger, the target receives a +4 bonus to the save. A natural roll of 1 is always a failure unless the total bonus is +20 or more. The Nets Table provides the appropriate net size for various victim sizes.</p><h4>Nets Table:</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Victim's Size</th><th>Approximate Height</th><th>Net Size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Very small</td><td>Up to 1'</td><td>2' x 2'</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>1+ to 3'</td><td>4' x 4'</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>3+ to 6'</td><td>6' x 6'</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>6+ to 10'</td><td>9' x 9'</td></tr><tr><td>Very large</td><td>10+ to 15'</td><td>12' x 12'</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>15+ to 20'</td><td>16' x 16'</td></tr><tr><td>Mammoth</td><td>20+ to 30'</td><td>25' x 25'</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Nets measuring 6' x 6' or smaller can be wielded with one hand. Larger nets require two hands and are subject to penalties associated with two-handed weapons. The wielder cannot use a shield, always loses individual initiative against those not using two-handed weapons, and halflings or small humanoids (like goblins) cannot use nets larger than 6' x 6'.</p><h3>Magical Nets:</h3><p>Magical nets are rare and impervious to all but fire or acid. Daggers and other weapons cannot cut through them, and an ensnared victim can only remove the net, not destroy it.</p><h3>Effects of Ensnarement:</h3><p>When ensnared, a victim suffers one of the following effects, as determined by the Weapon Special Effects Table:</p><ul><li><strong>Entangle</strong>: The victim cannot move, attack, or cast spells until a successful saving throw.</li><li><strong>Slow</strong>: The victim’s movement and attacks are halved, and they cannot cast spells.</li><li><strong>Delay</strong>: The victim automatically loses initiative in the next round.</li></ul><h3>Durability and Repair:</h3><p>A net is easily damaged by edged weapons, claws, or bites. If damaged, it becomes useless unless repaired. Repairing a net requires 1d3 turns of uninterrupted work with rope or cord.</p><p>A well-maintained net remains a practical and effective tool for adventurers, offering non-lethal means of control and strategy in combat.</p>",

For example:</p><ul><li>At 9th level, the paladin turns undead as a 3rd-level cleric.</li><li>At 16th or 17th level, the paladin turns undead as a 5th-level cleric.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Hireling Limit</strong>: The paladin can be accompanied by a number of hirelings equal to or less than their effective clerical level. For example, a paladin with the abilities of a 5th-level cleric may travel with up to five hirelings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assisting Others</strong>: A paladin must provide aid to anyone who requests it, except in the following cases:</p><ul><li>The paladin is not obligated to assist evil individuals or support evil goals.</li><li>If engaged in a mission for a higher authority (such as a quest or serving a noble), the paladin may offer limited help, such as advice or temporary shelter, and must explain their inability to provide further assistance. Aid is limited to services and does not include monetary or material donations.</li></ul></li></ol><hr><p></p><h3>Paladin Turn Undead Table</h3><div style=\"padding:4px;\"><table style=\"border-style:none;
