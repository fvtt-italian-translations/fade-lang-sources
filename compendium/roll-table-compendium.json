You might introduce a magical area with effects like zero gravity, reversed gravity, growth to double size, or shrinking to 1 inch tall, with the effect lasting until leaving the area. Additionally, consider placing a huge creature recently slain, too large to fit through the corridors—prompting the question, \"But how did it get here?\" These bizarre features can enhance the atmosphere and intrigue of the dungeon, encouraging exploration and creativity.",
        "11-11": "The room is filled with a faint, glowing mist that obscures vision beyond 10 feet. Characters moving through it feel a tingling sensation. The mist might conceal a hidden object, a trap, or a creature, and its effects (if any) are revealed only after prolonged exposure or a specific action.",
        "12-12": "A large, cracked mirror dominates one wall. Anyone gazing into it sees their reflection subtly altered—older, younger, or as a different creature. Interacting with the mirror might trigger a magical effect, reveal a clue, or require a Wisdom check to avoid a minor curse.",

        "14-14": "A faint breeze carries the scent of flowers or decay through the room, though no source is visible. The air seems to whisper faintly, and characters with high Intelligence might discern a pattern or message in the sounds, leading to a hidden passage or warning.",
        "15-15": "The room’s walls are lined with shelves holding dozens of dusty tomes or scrolls. Most are mundane, but one or two might contain a minor spell, a map, or a riddle. Reading them takes time, and there’s a chance of triggering a trap or attracting unwanted attention.",
        "16-16": "A single, ornate chair sits in the center of the room, carved with strange runes. Sitting in it causes a sensation of warmth or cold, and the character might hear a telepathic voice offering cryptic advice, a warning, or a demand before fading away.",
        "17-17": "The ceiling is covered in faintly glowing crystals that pulse in a slow rhythm. Touching or striking them might cause them to dim, brighten, or release a harmless burst of light or sound, possibly alerting nearby creatures or revealing a hidden feature.",
        "18-18": "A small fountain bubbles in the corner, its water unnaturally clear. Drinking from it requires a Constitution check; success might grant a temporary boon (like +1 to a stat for an hour), while failure could cause nausea or a minor magical effect.",
        "19-19": "The room’s temperature is unnaturally hot or cold, causing discomfort. Prolonged exposure (more than a turn) requires a Constitution check to avoid fatigue or minor damage. The source might be magical or environmental, and neutralizing it could yield a reward.",

        "20-20": "A large, rusted cage sits in the room, its door slightly ajar. It’s empty, but claw marks and faint bloodstains suggest something escaped. The cage might be trapped, contain a hidden compartment, or serve as a clue to a nearby creature stalking the dungeon.",
        "3-3": "A shifting wall moves after the party passes, cutting off their exit. They must find another way out of the dungeon. The wall will shift back after a duration determined by a roll of [[/r 1d6]]: on a roll of 1-2, it will shift back in one turn; on a roll of 3-5, it will shift back in one hour; and on a roll of 6, it will shift back in one day.",
        "4-4": "The room (or stairs, or door, or item) moves (turns, drops, closes, rises, etc.) unexpectedly. It might be stopped if a Dexterity check is made, with a penalty of +1, +2, or +3 to the die roll, indicating that the party reacts quickly enough to prevent it.",
        "5-5": "The room contains a seemingly bottomless pool in the center of the room. Roll the Magic Pool table only after one or more characters commit to drinking from it. @Compendium[fade-compendiums.roll-table-compendium.RollTable.SxLgCljhvJfybE5j]",
        "6-6": "The room (or item, or treasure) emits strange noises, such as moaning, screaming, or whispering voices. These unsettling sounds can create an eerie atmosphere, potentially causing unease or fear among the characters. The source of the noises may be a mystery, leading to further investigation or caution as they explore the area.",
        "7-7": "A large statue of a person, monster, or gadget is found in the room. It may be valuable, magical, or too heavy to move. The statue could be alive, lonesome, and willing to talk—though it may not always tell the truth. It might also be concealing a trapdoor, hiding treasure, or serving as a guardian for something more significant. The presence of the statue invites curiosity and caution, as its true nature and purpose remain uncertain.",
        "8-8": "This feature could be a trapdoor leading up or down, secret stairs hidden behind a false wall, or an elevator that operates mysteriously. It may also be a magical portal that transports characters to another room, a different level, or even an entirely separate dungeon. The method of transportation may require a specific action, a key, or a magical incantation to activate, adding an element of intrigue and exploration to the environment.",
        "9-9": "This applies to any variation of a listed monster, such as a skeleton that shoots its fingertips like a Magic Missile, a two-headed giant ogre, or a \"goop\" dragon that spits green slime or gray ooze. It could also include a wild bore (a shaggy man who tells long, dreary stories), a quarterling (a half-sized halfling), or a Mouth Harpy (who can't sing but plays the harmonica). Other examples might be an Ogre Jelly (which looks like an ogre but has unusual properties) or a Rock and Roll Baboon. These unique variations add creativity and unpredictability to encounters, challenging players to adapt their strategies."
