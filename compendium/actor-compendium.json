      "biography": "<p>The Actaeon is a rare and solitary protector of woodland creatures. Standing 9 feet tall, it has the arms, torso, and face of a human, but the lower body and antlers of an elk. Covered in a brown, elklike hide, it can blend into forest environments as if invisible.</p><p>Actaeons react aggressively to the slaying of woodland creatures or other similar offenses. They often attack with large wooden or bone spears, appearing suddenly from hiding with a 1-5 chance on a 1d6 for surprise.</p><p>Once per day, an Actaeon can use a breath weapon that fills a 10' cube. Those caught must save vs. dragon breath or be polymorphed into a normal forest creature such as an owl, squirrel, or deer. A successful save results in a 24-hour transformation.</p><p>Actaeons are integral members of the woodland community, often found among creatures such as centaurs and dryads. Their rarity and bravery make them celebrated champions of the forest. They frequently collaborate with druids to safeguard the woodlands, particularly when a serious threat arises.</p><p>Some actaeons may possess spellcasting abilities; refer to the \"Monster Spellcasters\" section on page 215 for more details.</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Forests.<br><strong>Carrying Capacity:</strong> 3,000 cn at full speed; 6,000 cn at half speed.</p>",

should distort its results.</li>\n                        <li>The DM may <strong>disallow unreasonable wishes</strong>, causing the spell to fail.</li>\n                        <li>After a misinterpreted wish, the DM should explain the flaw in the phrasing.</li>\n                      </ul>\n                      <p>Examples of <strong>badly phrased wishes</strong>:</p>\n

for a million gold pieces.\"</em> → The gold lands on the character, crushing them, then disappears.</li>\n                        <li><em>\"I wish for permanent basilisk gaze powers.\"</em> → The caster grows an extra basilisk head.</li>\n                      </ul>\n\n                      <h3>Allowed Effects</h3>\n                      <p><strong>Spell Substitution:</strong> A wish can replicate:</p>\n                      <ul>\n                        <li>Any <strong>8th-level or lower magic-user spell</strong></li>\n                        <li>Any <strong>6th-level or lower

spells</strong>.</li>\n                        <li>If they succeed, <strong>half of the effect rebounds</strong> onto the caster, who also saves (at -4 penalty).</li>\n                        <li>If the wish <strong>only inconveniences</strong> (e.g., teleporting them into a prison), no saving throw is allowed.</li>\n                      </ul>\n\n                      <h3>Gaining Treasure</h3>\n                      <p>A wish can conjure up to <strong>50,000 gp</strong>, but:</p>\n                      <ul>\n                        <li>The caster <strong>loses 1 XP per gold piece</strong>

characters.</li>\n                        <li>However, a wish can grant demihumans <strong>+1 Hit Die</strong> (new max: <strong>9 for halflings, 11 for elves, 13 for dwarves</strong>).</li>\n                      </ul>\n\n                      <h3>Race Changes</h3>\n                      <p>A wish can permanently change a character's race:</p>\n                      <ul>\n                        <li>Demihumans become human <strong>fighters</strong> of the same level.</li>\n                        <li>Elves become <strong>magic-users or fighters</strong> (chosen by the wish caster).</li>\n                        <li>Humans become demihumans, but <strong>never above their racial level cap</strong>.</li>\n                        <li>If unwilling, the target gains a <strong>+5 bonus to their

It possesses three heads, each of which serves a different purpose in battle.</p>\n        <p>The chimera is a highly territorial and solitary beast, rarely seen in the company of others. It typically dwells in wild hills but can sometimes be found in deep dungeons or ruins. In some instances, chimeras are known to mate and live with their young in a small family group.</p>\n        <p>In combat, the chimera attacks fiercely with its multiple heads: the goat's head attempts to butt its foes, the lion’s head bites with deadly force, and the dragon’s head can either bite or unleash a fiery breath weapon. The dragon head’s breath attack is a cone of fire that extends 50 feet long and 10 feet wide at the far end, dealing 3d6 damage. It can breathe fire up to three times per day. In combat, there is a 50% chance each round that the chimera will use its breath attack if it has uses left.</p>\n        <p>Occasionally, a chimera will become rogue, attacking any nearby human settlements and attempting to drive all life from the area. These rogue chimeras are even more dangerous, as they will not stop their rampage until they are killed or their territory is completely empty of life.</p>\n        <strong>Terrain:</strong> Cavern, Hill, Mountain, Ruins.<br>\n        <strong>Load:</strong> 4,500 cn at full speed, 9,000 cn at half speed.<br>\n        <strong>Barding Multiplier:</strong> x 3.<br>",

They bear a striking resemblance to humans, aside from their towering height of 15 to 20 feet. These giants can breathe underwater but are capable of holding their breath for up to a full turn when briefly leaving the sea, a rare occurrence. Although they can wield weapons, usually massive spears dealing 1d10 × 4 damage, they seldom do so.</p><p>A remarkable ability of sea giants is their control over water currents. Underwater, they can generate a powerful surge in a cone extending 50 feet long and 30 feet wide at the base, forcefully propelling everything within the area 60 feet away without allowing a saving throw. Each affected creature must make a saving throw vs. death ray or be stunned for [[/r 1d6 #Rounds stunned by water surge]] rounds. On the ocean surface, this effect transforms into a massive wave measuring 120 feet long and 60 feet wide at its base, capable of dealing [[/r 2d6 #Hull points of damage]] hull points of damage to any vessel in its path​.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Deep Sea.</p>",

The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day.

It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 22 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin from the game. It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 27 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

It has ten small eyes on stalks atop its body, each with its own unique magical power, and a large central eye positioned on the front, with a toothy mouth below.</p><p>The Orb Guardian moves by means of a slow, natural flight that cannot be dispelled. It is highly intelligent, cruel, and greedy, and speaks many languages. This creature is typically found alone but may be accompanied by 1d6 young (each with 1/10 normal Hit Dice and eye effects, dealing 1d4 points of bite damage) with a 5% chance.</p><p>The central eye of an Orb Guardian emits an anti-magic ray, which negates all magical effects within 60 feet in front of it. Magical weapons in this area are treated as non-magical, and spells cast within the area of effect are instantly disrupted. Spells cast from outside the area are ruined when they enter its range. The Orb Guardian will turn to face any character who begins spellcasting, disrupting the spell. Once the anti-magic ray is no longer directed at an object or area, magical items and effects return to their normal function.</p><p>The anti-magic ray cannot be directed above or below the creature, only straight ahead. As the ray can negate any magic, even that of the smaller eyes, the Orb Guardian cannot use its smaller eye powers on targets within this area.</p><p>When attacking an Orb Guardian, players must declare whether they are aiming at the body, the large central eye, or an eye stalk, each with distinct armor class and hit points:</p><ul><li>The body has AC 0 and 50 hit points.</li><li>The central eye has AC 2 and 20 hit points.</li><li>An eye stalk has AC 7 and can withstand 12 hit points of damage. Damage to eye stalks does not contribute to killing the creature.</li></ul><p><strong>Small Eyes and Eyestalks:</strong> If an attack hits an eye stalk, the GM should randomly determine which stalk is damaged. A severed eye stalk is rendered nonfunctional, but partial damage does not impede its operation. Lost eyes regenerate in 2d4 days, and partially damaged stalks heal at a rate of 1 hit point per day.</p><p>The Orb Guardian can only direct four small eyes in one direction at a time and cannot target directly beneath its body. Each eye can fire a ray with a different spell-like effect once per round. The spell effects are detailed below, with reversed versions indicated by an asterisk.</p><p><strong>Eye Powers:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Charm Person</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Charm Monster</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Sleep</strong> (range 240')</li><li><strong>Telekinesis</strong> (range 120', up to 5,000 cn weight)</li><li><strong>Flesh to Stone</strong>* (range 120')</li><li><strong>Disintegrate</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Cause Fear</strong>* (range 120')</li><li><strong>Slow</strong>* (range 240')</li><li><strong>Cause Serious Wounds</strong>* (range 60')</li><li><strong>Death Spell</strong> (range 240')</li></ol><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Caverns, Ruins.</p>",

      "biography": "<p>An Undead Orb Guardian is similar in appearance to its living counterpart but is actually a construct created for a specific malevolent purpose. These creatures are never naturally undead; instead, they are crafted for dark deeds. The Undead Orb Guardian resembles a large floating sphere, about four feet in diameter, covered with tough, armor-plated skin. It has ten small eyes on stalks, each capable of a different magical effect, and a large central eye on the front of its body with a toothy mouth below. The creature moves using natural (non-magical) flight, and it is highly intelligent, capable of speaking many languages. A cleric of 25th level or higher can recognize it as an undead being upon sight.</p><p>Undead Orb Guardians are immune to normal, silver, and even +1 magical weapons; only a magical weapon of +2 or greater can harm them. They are unaffected by charm, hold, and sleep spells, as well as illusions, death rays, and poison. Their bodies regenerate 3 hit points per round once damaged. If reduced to 0 hit points, they shift into gaseous form and cannot regenerate until resting for 1 hour in complete darkness, after which their regeneration resumes. They often maintain areas of continual darkness around their lairs.</p><p>These creatures can assume gaseous form at will. In this state, they lose access to their special abilities but cannot be harmed except by magic that affects air. Their bite inflicts 2d10 points of damage and causes a two-level energy drain, similar to that of a vampire.</p><p>The central eye of an Undead Orb Guardian projects a ray of reflection, bouncing any spell cast at it back to the caster. Similarly, any attempt to turn undead from this direction reflects back onto the cleric, who must succeed in a saving throw vs. spells or flee in terror for 2d6 rounds. The creature will typically turn to face any spellcasting character to utilize this defense. This reflective ray only works in the front arc and cannot be directed above or behind the creature.</p><p>When attacking, the player must specify whether they are targeting the body, the large eye, or an eye stalk. Each part has different armor classes and hit points:</p><ul><li>The body has AC -4 and 90 hit points.</li><li>The central eye has AC -2 and 30 hit points.</li><li>Each eye stalk has AC 3 and can withstand 20 hit points of damage. Damage to the eye stalks does not count toward destroying the creature.</li></ul><p>Small eyes and eyestalks: Each small eye can be used once per round, and only three eyes can focus in one direction (forward, backward, etc.). If the target is above the creature, all ten eyes can be used. The Undead Orb Guardian often uses only two eyes per round unless it perceives a serious threat. If an eye is destroyed, it can regrow in 1d4 + 1 hours, although this regeneration is slower than that of the body.</p><p><strong>Eye Powers:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Animate Dead</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Charm</strong> (as vampire, 120' range, with a -2 penalty to the saving throw)</li><li><strong>Continual Darkness</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Death Spell</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Energy Drain</strong> (1 level, as wight)</li><li><strong>Energy Drain</strong> (2 levels, as spectre)</li><li><strong>Paralysis</strong> (as ghoul, range 60'; elves are immune to this ray)</li><li><strong>Animate Object</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Dispel Magic</strong> (26th level)</li><li><strong>Telekinesis</strong> (4,000 cn)</li></ol><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Cavern, Ruins.</p>",

These hounds are bred and trained by interplanar beings such as elemental rulers, amirs, and pashas as hunting animals, often deployed to track intrusive adventurers back to their home planes or, conversely, potentially charmed by adventurers to hunt villains across dimensions. They never appear on the Prime Plane unless summoned by greater powers.<br>In combat, a spectral hound bites, dealing damage and triggering a save vs. spells. A successful save limits the damage to 2d6, but failure initiates a gradual fading process, turning the victim translucent like the hound over 24 hours. The victim's equipment remains unaffected, but once fully faded, they cannot hold normal items, hear, or speak to unfaded beings, perceiving normal things as translucent while faded entities appear solid. A dimension door spell can restore a faded character to normal at any time by allowing them to step through it.

Both male and female sphinxes are extremely intelligent spellcasters; the female acts as a 12th-level cleric, the male as a 12th-level magic-user, with all saves against their spells at a -4 penalty. In combat, they use claws, bites, or spells, but their roar is their most formidable attack, usable twice per day. This roar affects all within 120 feet, forcing a save vs. spells at -4 or flee in fear for 1d6 turns. Within 60 feet, victims also face paralysis, being stunned for 1-6 rounds if they fail another save. Within 10 feet, the effects include fear, stun, 6d6 damage, and deafness for 1d10 turns without a save. Sphinxes are immune to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-level spells and nonmagical weapons. They enjoy puzzles, riddles, and trivia; solving these can avoid combat or gain friendship. When more than one sphinx is encountered, they are either a mated pair or with cubs.<br><b>Terrain:</b> Any; especially Desert<br><b>Load:</b> 6,000 cn at full speed; 12,000 cn at half speed.<br><b>Barding Multiplier:</b> x3</p>",

They are very intelligent and strongly evil, often more dangerous than they appear. Druj can split into four identical forms once per night, each poisonous and capable of attacking separately, with one form maintaining spell-like abilities. These abilities mimic cleric spells like darkness, silence 15' radius, cause disease, animate dead, and finger of death, cast as if by a 16th-level cleric, requiring concentration. Druj poison their victims on touch, causing immediate death if a saving throw vs. poison fails. Their presence spoils all consumable items within 30 feet, including normal food, water, holy water, rations, and magical potions, without allowing a saving throw, paralyzing plants and small insects, leading to their death if the spirit remains for over an hour. Druj can sense invisible things and attack them without penalty. They become invisible and nearly powerless at dawn, regaining powers at dusk, capable of traveling up to 24 miles per day in daylight.<br><b>Eye:</b> An eye druj darts to touch and poison its opponent without dealing damage, can gaze once per round to paralyze for 1d4 turns within 30 feet, automatically touching paralyzed victims.<br><b>Hand:</b> A hand druj inflicts 1d4 damage on hit, then holds on, causing damage each round equal to the victim's AC (ignoring dexterity and shield bonuses) plus 1d4; negative AC still causes 1d4 damage per round.<br><b>Skull:</b> A skull druj floats to bite, causing a save vs. spells or be frozen with fear, allowing automatic bites for 2d4 damage, with each bite requiring a save vs. poison.<br>The first successful turn attempt forces a druj's components to reunite for 1d4 + 1 rounds, after which further turning is handled normally. Druj are encountered singly unless commanded by a lich or higher Sphere of Death entity, where they might appear with other druj parts.<br><b>Terrain:</b> Any (usually Barren Lands and Ruins)</p>",

It is visible from 300 yards due to its purplish light with a 20-foot radius, causing energy drain to any living being within, reducing their level if they fail a save vs. spells. Once settled, it cannot move until daybreak but animates parts of the plant for attacks, such as branches or leaves. The longest branch or vine reaches out up to 30 feet, attacking as a 16 HD monster, dealing 1d12 damage plus poison. Leaves can move up to 1 mile away, surprising with a 90% chance, and can charm on touch, drawing victims towards the odic where they suffer a -4 penalty to saves against energy drain. If the plant lacks detachable parts, other portions are animated similarly, up to 6 at once, each with a charm ability. Odics can possess plantlike monsters, gaining their abilities in addition to its own, potentially leading to the monster's death from level drain even if the save against possession is successful. Odics become invisible and nearly powerless at dawn, regaining powers at dusk.<br><b>Terrain:</b> Any (usually Barren Lands and Ruins)</p>",

It uses its tentacles first, each dealing 1 damage and requiring a save vs. paralysis; failure leads to delayed paralysis after one round, lasting one turn unless cured. The bite is only used once all tentacles are destroyed, dealing 2d10 damage. The sporacle spins rapidly in combat, using all tentacles each round against one or two opponents. It cannot use spells or magical items and is of average intelligence (10).<br>The creature is immune to blunt weapons, sound-based effects, poison, paralysis, and charms. It can be damaged by edged or missile weapons (except slings); spells that cause damage affect only its tentacles, destroying one tentacle per die of damage.

They can detect invisible creatures at will and use spells like detect magic, web, dispel magic, ice storm/wall, and fire to ice three times per day, as if cast by a 9th level magic-user. Their web, made of ice strands, functions like a normal web but melts harmlessly when exposed to flame.<br>An undine's attack involves shaping water into a 'fist' for melee combat or coiling around an opponent for constriction damage. On the Prime Plane, they resemble water elementals, becoming invisible in water and regenerating damage, but they take damage from drying out when not submerged. Unlike elementals, they are not limited by protection from evil or proximity to water.<br>Undines have natural enemies in the hydrax and hordes, and they are wary of air-type creatures and attacks.<br><b>Terrain:</b> Plane of Water</p>",

These creatures are known for their ability to transform shape, their supernatural resilience, and their capacity to drain life force.<br>Vampires are immune to spells like sleep, charm, and hold, and can only be harmed by magical weaponry. They possess the chilling power to transform into a human guise, a dire wolf, a giant bat, or a cloud of gas, with each transformation requiring one round. No matter the form, vampires regenerate at a rate of 3 hit points per round once injured. Should their hit points reach zero, they turn into gas and escape to their coffins to heal.<br>In human form, a vampire can attack with a deadly touch that not only deals damage but also drains double the life energy of the victim, or use its gaze to enthrall opponents. The gaze requires a saving throw vs. spells at a -2 penalty to resist the charm. Additionally, a vampire can call forth allies within 300 feet (or 300 yards outdoors) including swarms of rats, bats, or packs of dire wolves.<br>A human killed by a vampire rises as one themselves three days later, under the control of their creator. Vampires can also be spellcasters.<br><b>Weaknesses:</b> They are repelled by strongly presented holy symbols, cannot approach garlic without making a saving throw vs. poison, and are unable to cross running water except at bridges or within their coffins. During daylight, they must rest in their coffins or lose hit points, which won't regenerate until they've rested for a full day. Vampires cast no reflection, thus they shun mirrors. They can be destroyed by a wooden stake through the heart or by prolonged exposure to running water. In sunlight, they must save vs. death ray each round or disintegrate; however, a continual light spell does not have this effect. If all their resting places are blessed or destroyed, they weaken, losing hit points until they perish.<br><b>Terrain:</b> Ruins, Tombs, Crypts</p>",
