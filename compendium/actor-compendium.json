Covered in a brown, elklike hide, it can blend into forest environments as if invisible.</p><p>Actaeons react aggressively to the slaying of woodland creatures or other similar offenses. They often attack with large wooden or bone spears, appearing suddenly from hiding with a 1-5 chance on a 1d6 for surprise.</p><p>Once per day, an Actaeon can use a breath weapon that fills a 10' cube. Those caught must save vs. dragon breath or be polymorphed into a normal forest creature such as an owl, squirrel, or deer. A successful save results in a 24-hour transformation.</p><p>Actaeons are integral members of the woodland community, often found among creatures such as centaurs and dryads. Their rarity and bravery make them celebrated champions of the forest. They frequently collaborate with druids to safeguard the woodlands, particularly when a serious threat arises.</p><p>Some actaeons may possess spellcasting abilities; refer to the \"Monster Spellcasters\" section on page 215 for more details.</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Forests.<br><strong>Carrying Capacity:</strong> 3,000 cn at full speed; 6,000 cn at half speed.</p>",

It is highly intelligent, cruel, and greedy, and speaks many languages. This creature is typically found alone but may be accompanied by 1d6 young (each with 1/10 normal Hit Dice and eye effects, dealing 1d4 points of bite damage) with a 5% chance.</p><p>The central eye of an Orb Guardian emits an anti-magic ray, which negates all magical effects within 60 feet in front of it. Magical weapons in this area are treated as non-magical, and spells cast within the area of effect are instantly disrupted. Spells cast from outside the area are ruined when they enter its range. The Orb Guardian will turn to face any character who begins spellcasting, disrupting the spell. Once the anti-magic ray is no longer directed at an object or area, magical items and effects return to their normal function.</p><p>The anti-magic ray cannot be directed above or below the creature, only straight ahead. As the ray can negate any magic, even that of the smaller eyes, the Orb Guardian cannot use its smaller eye powers on targets within this area.</p><p>When attacking an Orb Guardian, players must declare whether they are aiming at the body, the large central eye, or an eye stalk, each with distinct armor class and hit points:</p><ul><li>The body has AC 0 and 50 hit points.</li><li>The central eye has AC 2 and 20 hit points.</li><li>An eye stalk has AC 7 and can withstand 12 hit points of damage. Damage to eye stalks does not contribute to killing the creature.</li></ul><p><strong>Small Eyes and Eyestalks:</strong> If an attack hits an eye stalk, the GM should randomly determine which stalk is damaged. A severed eye stalk is rendered nonfunctional, but partial damage does not impede its operation.

      "biography": "<p>An Undead Orb Guardian is similar in appearance to its living counterpart but is actually a construct created for a specific malevolent purpose. These creatures are never naturally undead; instead, they are crafted for dark deeds. The Undead Orb Guardian resembles a large floating sphere, about four feet in diameter, covered with tough, armor-plated skin. It has ten small eyes on stalks, each capable of a different magical effect, and a large central eye on the front of its body with a toothy mouth below. The creature moves using natural (non-magical) flight, and it is highly intelligent, capable of speaking many languages. A cleric of 25th level or higher can recognize it as an undead being upon sight.</p><p>Undead Orb Guardians are immune to normal, silver, and even +1 magical weapons; only a magical weapon of +2 or greater can harm them. They are unaffected by charm, hold, and sleep spells, as well as illusions, death rays, and poison. Their bodies regenerate 3 hit points per round once damaged. If reduced to 0 hit points, they shift into gaseous form and cannot regenerate until resting for 1 hour in complete darkness, after which their regeneration resumes. They often maintain areas of continual darkness around their lairs.</p><p>These creatures can assume gaseous form at will. In this state, they lose access to their special abilities but cannot be harmed except by magic that affects air. Their bite inflicts 2d10 points of damage and causes a two-level energy drain, similar to that of a vampire.</p><p>The central eye of an Undead Orb Guardian projects a ray of reflection, bouncing any spell cast at it back to the caster. Similarly, any attempt to turn undead from this direction reflects back onto the cleric, who must succeed in a saving throw vs. spells or flee in terror for 2d6 rounds. The creature will typically turn to face any spellcasting character to utilize this defense. This reflective ray only works in the front arc and cannot be directed above or behind the creature.</p><p>When attacking, the player must specify whether they are targeting the body, the large eye, or an eye stalk. Each part has different armor classes and hit points:</p><ul><li>The body has AC -4 and 90 hit points.</li><li>The central eye has AC -2 and 30 hit points.</li><li>Each eye stalk has AC 3 and can withstand 20 hit points of damage. Damage to the eye stalks does not count toward destroying the creature.</li></ul><p>Small eyes and eyestalks: Each small eye can be used once per round, and only three eyes can focus in one direction (forward, backward, etc.). If the target is above the creature, all ten eyes can be used. The Undead Orb Guardian often uses only two eyes per round unless it perceives a serious threat. If an eye is destroyed, it can regrow in 1d4 + 1 hours, although this regeneration is slower than that of the body.</p><p><strong>Eye Powers:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Animate Dead</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Charm</strong> (as vampire, 120' range, with a -2 penalty to the saving throw)</li><li><strong>Continual Darkness</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Death Spell</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Energy Drain</strong> (1 level, as wight)</li><li><strong>Energy Drain</strong> (2 levels, as spectre)</li><li><strong>Paralysis</strong> (as ghoul, range 60'; elves are immune to this ray)</li><li><strong>Animate Object</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Dispel Magic</strong> (26th level)</li><li><strong>Telekinesis</strong> (4,000 cn)</li></ol><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Cavern, Ruins.</p>",
