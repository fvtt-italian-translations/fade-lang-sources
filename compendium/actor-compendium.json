They often attack with large wooden or bone spears, appearing suddenly from hiding with a 1-5 chance on a 1d6 for surprise.</p><p>Once per day, an Actaeon can use a breath weapon that fills a 10' cube. Those caught must save vs. dragon breath or be polymorphed into a normal forest creature such as an owl, squirrel, or deer. A successful save results in a 24-hour transformation.</p><p>Actaeons are integral members of the woodland community, often found among creatures such as centaurs and dryads. Their rarity and bravery make them celebrated champions of the forest. They frequently collaborate with druids to safeguard the woodlands, particularly when a serious threat arises.</p><p>Some actaeons may possess spellcasting abilities.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Forests.</p><p><strong>Load:</strong> 3,000 cn at full speed; 6,000 cn at half speed.</p>",

The ruler should grant the land unless there are past issues; in such cases, the ruler may require a service, like a quest, before approval. The DM will determine if the cleric's order has the authority to grant land based on the campaign's setting.</p><p>If the cleric has a clean record, his order may assist with construction costs, typically covering up to 50% of the expenses. The player can design the stronghold, and the DM will assess the costs, deciding what portion the order will fund. Regardless of the financial support, the stronghold remains the cleric's property, and he cannot deny access to order members, nor can he be reassigned against his will.</p><p>Once the stronghold is built, a number of lower-level clerics (typically 1d6) will arrive to assist with its clerical functions. These clerics are there to help operate the stronghold, not to join the cleric on adventures. The DM should create each assistant cleric with their own name, personality, background, goals, and abilities.</p><p>If the cleric manages his land and serves his order well, he is likely to gain power within the clerical hierarchy, receive additional land, and see an increase in tax income from the growing settlements around his stronghold.</p>",

It has ten small eyes on stalks atop its body, each with its own unique magical power, and a large central eye positioned on the front, with a toothy mouth below.</p><p>The beholder moves by means of a slow, natural flight that cannot be dispelled. It is highly intelligent, cruel, and greedy, and speaks many languages. This creature is typically found alone but may be accompanied by 1d6 young (each with 1/10 normal Hit Dice and eye effects, dealing 1d4 points of bite damage) with a 5% chance.</p><p>The central eye of an beholder emits an anti-magic ray, which negates all magical effects within 60 feet in front of it. Magical weapons in this area are treated as non-magical, and spells cast within the area of effect are instantly disrupted. Spells cast from outside the area are ruined when they enter its range. The beholder will turn to face any character who begins spellcasting, disrupting the spell. Once the anti-magic ray is no longer directed at an object or area, magical items and effects return to their normal function.</p><p>The anti-magic ray cannot be directed above or below the creature, only straight ahead. As the ray can negate any magic, even that of the smaller eyes, the beholder cannot use its smaller eye powers on targets within this area.</p><p>When attacking an beholder, players must declare whether they are aiming at the body, the large central eye, or an eye stalk, each with distinct armor class and hit points:</p><ul><li>The body has AC 0 and 50 hit points.</li><li>The central eye has AC 2 and 20 hit points.</li><li>An eye stalk has AC 7 and can withstand 12 hit points of damage. Damage to eye stalks does not contribute to killing the creature.</li></ul><p><strong>Small Eyes and Eyestalks:</strong> If an attack hits an eye stalk, the GM should randomly determine which stalk is damaged. A severed eye stalk is rendered nonfunctional, but partial damage does not impede its operation. Lost eyes regenerate in 2d4 days, and partially damaged stalks heal at a rate of 1 hit point per day.</p><p>The beholder can only direct four small eyes in one direction at a time and cannot target directly beneath its body. Each eye can fire a ray with a different spell-like effect once per round. The spell effects are detailed below, with reversed versions indicated by an asterisk.</p><p><strong>Eye Powers:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Charm Person</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Charm Monster</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Sleep</strong> (range 240')</li><li><strong>Telekinesis</strong> (range 120', up to 5,000 cn weight)</li><li><strong>Flesh to Stone</strong>* (range 120')</li><li><strong>Disintegrate</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Cause Fear</strong>* (range 120')</li><li><strong>Slow</strong>* (range 240')</li><li><strong>Cause Serious Wounds</strong>* (range 60')</li><li><strong>Death Spell</strong> (range 240')</li></ol><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Caverns, Ruins.</p>",

      "biography": "<p>An undead beholder is similar in appearance to its living counterpart but is actually a construct created for a specific malevolent purpose. These creatures are never naturally undead; instead, they are crafted for dark deeds. The undead beholder resembles a large floating sphere, about four feet in diameter, covered with tough, armor-plated skin. It has ten small eyes on stalks, each capable of a different magical effect, and a large central eye on the front of its body with a toothy mouth below. The creature moves using natural (non-magical) flight, and it is highly intelligent, capable of speaking many languages. A cleric of 25th level or higher can recognize it as an undead being upon sight.</p><p>Undead beholders are immune to normal, silver, and even +1 magical weapons; only a magical weapon of +2 or greater can harm them. They are unaffected by charm, hold, and sleep spells, as well as illusions, death rays, and poison. Their bodies regenerate 3 hit points per round once damaged. If reduced to 0 hit points, they shift into gaseous form and cannot regenerate until resting for 1 hour in complete darkness, after which their regeneration resumes. They often maintain areas of continual darkness around their lairs.</p><p>These creatures can assume gaseous form at will. In this state, they lose access to their special abilities but cannot be harmed except by magic that affects air. Their bite inflicts 2d10 points of damage and causes a two-level energy drain, similar to that of a vampire.</p><p>The central eye of an undead beholder projects a ray of reflection, bouncing any spell cast at it back to the caster. Similarly, any attempt to turn undead from this direction reflects back onto the cleric, who must succeed in a saving throw vs. spells or flee in terror for 2d6 rounds. The creature will typically turn to face any spellcasting character to utilize this defense. This reflective ray only works in the front arc and cannot be directed above or behind the creature.</p><p>When attacking, the player must specify whether they are targeting the body, the large eye, or an eye stalk. Each part has different armor classes and hit points:</p><ul><li>The body has AC -4 and 90 hit points.</li><li>The central eye has AC -2 and 30 hit points.</li><li>Each eye stalk has AC 3 and can withstand 20 hit points of damage. Damage to the eye stalks does not count toward destroying the creature.</li></ul><p>Small eyes and eyestalks: Each small eye can be used once per round, and only three eyes can focus in one direction (forward, backward, etc.). If the target is above the creature, all ten eyes can be used. The Undead beholder often uses only two eyes per round unless it perceives a serious threat. If an eye is destroyed, it can regrow in 1d4 + 1 hours, although this regeneration is slower than that of the body.</p><p><strong>Eye Powers:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Animate Dead</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Charm</strong> (as vampire, 120' range, with a -2 penalty to the saving throw)</li><li><strong>Continual Darkness</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Death Spell</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Energy Drain</strong> (1 level, as wight)</li><li><strong>Energy Drain</strong> (2 levels, as spectre)</li><li><strong>Paralysis</strong> (as ghoul, range 60'; elves are immune to this ray)</li><li><strong>Animate Object</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Dispel Magic</strong> (26th level)</li><li><strong>Telekinesis</strong> (4,000 cn)</li></ol><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Cavern, Ruins.</p>",

They hunt herd animals and frequently raid farms, targeting grain stores and smokehouses. During desperate times, they may even turn to hunting humans for sustenance. Despite their brutish appearance, bugbears possess cunning intelligence.

The vehicles can be loaded heavier, but movement speeds will suffer.</p><p>Simply put, if the animal's normal encumbrance value is equal to or higher than the weight in the vehicle, it can pull it at its normal speed. If the encumbrance of the vehicle exceeds the animal's normal encumbrance value, it can be pulled at half the animal's normal speed.</p><p>For example, one draft horse pulls a cart loaded down with 3,000 cn of cargo; this cart could travel at the horse's maximum rate of 90' (30'), though speeds greater than 60' (20') risk upsetting the vehicle and the cargo.

When a flying dragon attacks an aerial target, it gets two claw attacks and one bite attack but cannot use wing, kick, or tail attacks. When attacking a ground-level victim from the air, a dragon can use one Crush, Hover, or Swoop attack (as described below), but not two in combination.</p><p>If a dragon attacks while on the ground, it can substitute a wing, kick, or tail attack for any of its normal attacks, so long as it makes only three attacks in the round. (For example, the dragon might bite one target, kick another, and sweep its tail across a third instead of using two claws and one bite.)</p><h3>Combat Tactics</h3><p>Huge dragons use all attacks effectively against any opponent within melee range through maneuvering. Wing attacks can be aimed at any opponents to the sides, or, if more than one opponent is in front of the dragon, against those on either side. If its swoop attack hits, a huge dragon can pick up one, two, or three man-sized victims, two horse-sized victims, or one giant-sized opponent.</p><p>Large and huge dragons use breath weapons intelligently, not randomly.

When attacking a ground-level victim from the air, a dragon can use one Crush, Hover, or Swoop attack (as described below), but not two in combination.</p><p>If a dragon attacks while on the ground, it can substitute a wing, kick, or tail attack for any of its normal attacks, so long as it makes only three attacks in the round. (For example, the dragon might bite one target, kick another, and sweep its tail across a third instead of using two claws and one bite.)</p><h3>Combat Tactics</h3><p>Large dragons use all attacks except wings. Kick attacks can be used against any opponents</p><p>within 10' of the body. A tail attack can be aimed at any opponent to the rear or sides. If its swoop attack hits, a large dragon can pick up one or two man-sized opponents, or one horse-sized creature.</p><p>Large and huge dragons use breath weapons intelligently, not randomly. They rarely aim at single opponents and normally save the attack for use against groups. The volume of the breath weapon increases with the size of the dragon.</p><p></p><p><strong>Breath Weapon:</strong> Acid, 90 feet long and 5 feet wide, dealing damage equal to the dragon's current hit points.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Swamps, Marshes</p><p><strong>Load:</strong> A dragon can move at its full speed when carrying 1,000 times its Hit Dice; or at half speed when carrying 2,000 times its Hit Dice.</p><p><strong>Barding Multiplier:</strong> This varies depending on size: Small Dragon x 3, Large Dragon x 5, Huge Dragon x 10.</p>",

In addition to its physical attacks, the Large Blue Dragon is an adept spellcaster, making it even more formidable.</p><h3>Types of Physical Attacks</h3><p>Dragons usually make two claw attacks and one bite attack; at the OM's option, they can use other special attack forms (kick, tail, wing) defined later. When a flying dragon attacks an aerial target, it gets two claw attacks and one bite attack but cannot use wing, kick, or tail attacks. When attacking a ground-level victim from the air, a dragon can use one Crush, Hover, or Swoop attack (as described below), but not two in combination.</p><p>If a dragon attacks while on the ground, it can substitute a wing, kick, or tail attack for any of its normal attacks, so long as it makes only three attacks in the round. (For example, the dragon might bite one target, kick another, and sweep its tail across a third instead of using two claws and one bite.)</p><h3>Combat Tactics</h3><p>Large dragons use all attacks except wings. Kick attacks can be used against any opponents</p><p>within 10' of the body. A tail attack can be aimed at any opponent to the rear or sides. If its swoop attack hits, a large dragon can pick up one or two man-sized opponents, or one horse-sized creature.</p><p>Large and huge dragons use breath weapons intelligently, not randomly. They rarely aim at single opponents and normally save the attack for use against groups. The volume of the breath weapon increases with the size of the dragon.</p><p></p><p><strong>Breath Weapon:</strong> Lightning, 150 feet long and 5 feet wide, dealing damage equal to the dragon's current hit points.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Desert, Rocky Areas</p><p><strong>Load:</strong> A dragon can move at its full speed when carrying 1,000 times its Hit Dice; or at half speed when carrying 2,000 times its Hit Dice.</p><p><strong>Barding Multiplier:</strong> This varies depending on size: Small Dragon x 3, Large Dragon x 5, Huge Dragon x 10.</p>",

This majestic dragon can breathe either a cone of fire, 180 feet long and 30 feet wide, or a chlorine gas cloud, 50 feet wide, 50 feet deep, and 30 feet high. Both breath attacks deal dealing equal to the dragon's current hit point value. Known for its immense spellcasting abilities, the Huge Gold Dragon can cast powerful spells to supplement its physical might, making it one of the most dangerous and honorable dragons to encounter.</p><h3>Types of Physical Attacks</h3><p>Dragons usually make two claw attacks and one bite attack; at the OM's option, they can use other special attack forms (kick, tail, wing) defined later. When a flying dragon attacks an aerial target, it gets two claw attacks and one bite attack but cannot use wing, kick, or tail attacks. When attacking a ground-level victim from the air, a dragon can use one Crush, Hover, or Swoop attack (as described below), but not two in combination.</p><p>If a dragon attacks while on the ground, it can substitute a wing, kick, or tail attack for any of its normal attacks, so long as it makes only three attacks in the round. (For example, the dragon might bite one target, kick another, and sweep its tail across a third instead of using two claws and one bite.)</p><h3>Combat Tactics</h3><p>Huge dragons use all attacks effectively against any opponent within melee range through maneuvering. Wing attacks can be aimed at any opponents to the sides, or, if more than one opponent is in front of the dragon, against those on either side. If its swoop attack hits, a huge dragon can pick up one, two, or three man-sized victims, two horse-sized victims, or one giant-sized opponent.</p><p>Large and huge dragons use breath weapons intelligently, not randomly. They rarely aim at single opponents and normally save the attack for use against groups. The volume of the breath weapon increases with the size of the dragon.</p><p></p><p><strong>Breath Weapon:</strong> Either Fire (180 feet long, 30 feet wide) or Chlorine gas (50 feet wide, 50 feet deep, 30 feet high), dealing damage equal to the dragon's current hit points.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Mountains, Caves</p><p><strong>Load:</strong> A dragon can move at its full speed when carrying 1,000 times its Hit Dice; or at half speed when carrying 2,000 times its Hit Dice.</p><p><strong>Barding Multiplier:</strong> This varies depending on size: Small Dragon x 3, Large Dragon x 5, Huge Dragon x 10.</p>",

The Huge Green Dragon is highly intelligent and magically potent, capable of casting spells in addition to its formidable physical abilities.</p><h3>Types of Physical Attacks</h3><p>Dragons usually make two claw attacks and one bite attack; at the OM's option, they can use other special attack forms (kick, tail, wing) defined later. When a flying dragon attacks an aerial target, it gets two claw attacks and one bite attack but cannot use wing, kick, or tail attacks. When attacking a ground-level victim from the air, a dragon can use one Crush, Hover, or Swoop attack (as described below), but not two in combination.</p><p>If a dragon attacks while on the ground, it can substitute a wing, kick, or tail attack for any of its normal attacks, so long as it makes only three attacks in the round. (For example, the dragon might bite one target, kick another, and sweep its tail across a third instead of using two claws and one bite.)</p><h3>Combat Tactics</h3><p>Huge dragons use all attacks effectively against any opponent within melee range through maneuvering. Wing attacks can be aimed at any opponents to the sides, or, if more than one opponent is in front of the dragon, against those on either side. If its swoop attack hits, a huge dragon can pick up one, two, or three man-sized victims, two horse-sized victims, or one giant-sized opponent.</p><p>Large and huge dragons use breath weapons intelligently, not randomly.

When a flying dragon attacks an aerial target, it gets two claw attacks and one bite attack but cannot use wing, kick, or tail attacks. When attacking a ground-level victim from the air, a dragon can use one Crush, Hover, or Swoop attack (as described below), but not two in combination.</p><p>If a dragon attacks while on the ground, it can substitute a wing, kick, or tail attack for any of its normal attacks, so long as it makes only three attacks in the round. (For example, the dragon might bite one target, kick another, and sweep its tail across a third instead of using two claws and one bite.)</p><h3>Combat Tactics</h3><p>Large dragons use all attacks except wings. Kick attacks can be used against any opponents</p><p>within 10' of the body. A tail attack can be aimed at any opponent to the rear or sides. If its swoop attack hits, a large dragon can pick up one or two man-sized opponents, or one horse-sized creature.</p><p>Large and huge dragons use breath weapons intelligently, not randomly.

Only magic-users of 36th level with a Wisdom score of 18 or greater may cast this spell.</p><h4>Wording the Wish:</h4><p>The player must clearly state or write the exact wish. The wording is critically important, as the wish will usually follow the literal meaning of the words spoken—regardless of the caster's intentions.</p><p>The DM is responsible for maintaining game balance. Poorly worded wishes may have unintended consequences, while selfish or greedy wishes may be deliberately twisted by the DM. If a wish is unreasonable, the DM may simply rule that it has no effect.</p><h4>Examples of Faulty Wishes:</h4><ul><li>\"I wish that I knew everything about this dungeon.\" - The character gains full knowledge for a moment but then immediately forgets everything.</li><li>\"I wish for a million gold pieces.\" - The gold pieces may appear, but they might land on the caster (crushing them) and then vanish.</li><li>\"I wish to permanently gain the gaze power of a basilisk while retaining all my abilities.\" - This could result in the caster growing an additional basilisk head.</li></ul><h4>Wish Limitations & Effects:</h4><ul><li>A wish cannot be used to gain experience points or levels.</li><li>A properly worded wish can substitute for any magic-user spell of 8th level or lower or any clerical or druidic spell of 6th level or lower at the DM’s discretion.</li><li>If the wish is used to harm a creature, the target may make a saving throw vs. spells. If successful, the effect is halved, and the other half rebounds on the caster (who may save with a -4 penalty).</li><li>If the wish is used to inconvenience rather than harm (such as teleporting a victim into a prison cell), no saving throw is allowed.</li></ul><h4>Special Uses of a Wish:</h4><ul><li>A wish can create treasure, up to 50,000 gold pieces. However, the caster loses 1 XP per gold piece gained, and this loss cannot be restored.</li><li>A wish can temporarily change one ability score to a minimum of 3 or maximum of 18, lasting six turns.</li><li>Permanent ability score increases require casting a number of wishes equal to the desired score (e.g., raising Strength from 15 to 16 requires 16 wishes within one week).</li><li>Wishes cannot permanently lower ability scores.</li></ul><h4>Racial & Class Effects:</h4><ul><li>A wish cannot raise a human character beyond 36th level, but it can grant a demihuman one additional Hit Die (maximum HD: Halflings 9, Elves 11, Dwarves 13).</li><li>A wish can change a demihuman to a human (or vice versa), allowing them to advance as a new class at the same level.</li><li>If a wish is used to change another character’s class, the target may make a saving throw vs. spells with a +5 bonus to resist.</li></ul><h4>Altering Past Events:</h4><p>A wish can alter events from the past 24 hours. However, it cannot fully overturn impossible odds. Examples include:</p><ul><li>A lost battle may be changed into a less severe defeat.</li><li>A character’s death could instead become a near-death experience.</li><li>A permanent loss may be converted into a temporary one.</li></ul><h4>Important Note:</h4><p>If an effect is stated to be unchangeable \"even with a wish\", this limitation overrides the spell’s normal capabilities.</p><h4>Game Balance & DM Discretion:</h4><p>The DM must ensure that wishes remain within reason. A wish cannot alter fundamental game mechanics (such as preventing dragons from using their breath weapons). The more unreasonable a wish is, the less likely it is to succeed as intended.</p>",

          "description": "<p>The Guardian Owl possesses a unique ability to summon assistance from other woodland creatures. Once per day, the Guardian Owl can emit a resonant call that echoes through the forest, reaching the ears of nearby allies. This call can attract a variety of creatures, including centaurs, dryads, unicorns, and other friendly woodland beings, who are drawn to aid the Guardian Owl in times of need.</p><p>When the Guardian Owl uses this ability, it can request specific types of assistance, such as healing, combat support, or guidance through the forest. The summoned creatures will arrive within a few rounds, ready to assist the Guardian Owl and its allies. The number and strength of the creatures that respond depend on the situation and the Guardian Owl's relationship with the local fauna. This ability reflects the Guardian Owl's role as a protector of the woodland realm, fostering harmony and cooperation among its inhabitants.</p>",

Hsiao look like giant owls with broad feathered wings and large intelligent golden eyes. These creatures live in trees, making earthen nests and runnels high above the forest floor.</p><p>The Guardian Owls know and work closely with other woodland creatures (including actaeons, centaurs, dryads, elves, giants, and unicorns) and may call on them for aid. Their goals include the preservation of woodland wilderness against intrusions by dangerous humanoids. They will not interfere with passing PCs who do no damage to the woodlands or the races of the forest.</p><p>Most of these avian clerics are 4th level; 25% are higher levels (as given above; maximum level is 15th). Although able to physically defend themselves with their sharp claws and beak, these creatures depend on their spells and the assistance of their woodland allies for protection. The Guardian Owls are known to some druids, though their philosophies (alignments) obviously differ greatly.</p><p>No one knows where these creatures come from, but their alignment and clerical powers suggest that they were created to serve the ends of lawful mortals.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Woods.</p><p><strong>Load:</strong> A Guardian Owl can move at up to full speed when carrying <strong>250 cn x its HD</strong> in encumbrance; it can move at half speed when carrying <strong>500 cn x its HD</strong>.</p>",

No holy symbol or other item is needed unless the DM specifies otherwise. The success of this attempt depends on the cleric’s level and the type of undead faced, as indicated on the Turning Undead table.</p><p>If the cleric succeeds, one or more undead creatures will flee or be destroyed immediately, depending on the result. However, a failed attempt means that particular undead creature cannot be turned by the cleric again during the same encounter. Multiple attempts are allowed in future encounters.</p><p>Should the attempt succeed, the Dungeon Master rolls to determine how many Hit Dice worth of undead are turned. At least one undead creature will always be affected. A turned undead creature will retreat as far as possible, but it has not been destroyed and may return after some time.</p>",

Once per day, the Guardian Owl can emit a resonant call that echoes through the forest, reaching the ears of nearby allies. This call can attract a variety of creatures, including centaurs, dryads, unicorns, and other friendly woodland beings, who are drawn to aid the Guardian Owl in times of need.</p><p>When the Guardian Owl uses this ability, it can request specific types of assistance, such as healing, combat support, or guidance through the forest. The summoned creatures will arrive within a few rounds, ready to assist the Guardian Owl and its allies. The number and strength of the creatures that respond depend on the situation and the Guardian Owl's relationship with the local fauna.

Hsiao look like giant owls with broad feathered wings and large intelligent golden eyes. These creatures live in trees, making earthen nests and runnels high above the forest floor.</p><p>The Guardian Owls know and work closely with other woodland creatures (including actaeons, centaurs, dryads, elves, giants, and unicorns) and may call on them for aid. Their goals include the preservation of woodland wilderness against intrusions by dangerous humanoids. They will not interfere with passing PCs who do no damage to the woodlands or the races of the forest.</p><p>Most of these avian clerics are 4th level; 25% are higher levels (as given above; maximum level is 15th). Although able to physically defend themselves with their sharp claws and beak, these creatures depend on their spells and the assistance of their woodland allies for protection. The Guardian Owls are known to some druids, though their philosophies (alignments) obviously differ greatly.</p><p>No one knows where these creatures come from, but their alignment and clerical powers suggest that they were created to serve the ends of lawful mortals.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Woods.</p><p><strong>Load:</strong> A Guardian Owl can move at up to full speed when carrying <strong>250 cn x its HD</strong> in encumbrance; it can move at half speed when carrying <strong>500 cn x its HD</strong>.</p>",

Their goals include the preservation of woodland wilderness against intrusions by dangerous humanoids. They will not interfere with passing PCs who do no damage to the woodlands or the races of the forest.</p><p>Most of these avian clerics are 4th level; 25% are higher levels (as given above; maximum level is 15th). Although able to physically defend themselves with their sharp claws and beak, these creatures depend on their spells and the assistance of their woodland allies for protection. The Guardian Owls are known to some druids, though their philosophies (alignments) obviously differ greatly.</p><p>No one knows where these creatures come from, but their alignment and clerical powers suggest that they were created to serve the ends of lawful mortals.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Woods.</p><p><strong>Load:</strong> A Guardian Owl can move at up to full speed when carrying <strong>250 cn x its HD</strong> in encumbrance; it can move at half speed when carrying <strong>500 cn x its HD</strong>.</p>",

When given a clear and straightforward command, it obeys without hesitation; however, if the assignment is ambiguous or prolonged, it may twist the intent while following the literal wording—for example, guarding a treasure for over a week might result in it transporting the treasure back to its native plane to guard indefinitely.</p><p>Primarily employed to track and eliminate foes, this creature is not only highly intelligent but also an impeccable tracker. Should a target be unable to detect invisible entities, the stalker will launch a surprise attack on a roll of 1-5 (on [[/r 1d6 #Surprise on 1-5]]). Conversely, any creature capable of perceiving invisibility gains a +4 bonus when attacking it. Once its mission is complete, or if it is slain or dispelled, the stalker promptly returns to its home plane.</p><p>The term \"invisible stalkers\" is the human designation for this species, though they call themselves the <em>sshai</em>. Native to the elemental plane of Air, the sshai move with exceptional speed on their home plane—reaching 360' (120'). There, they resemble dopplegangers, possessing the ability to use ESP at will and to shapechange into nearly any form native to that plane, typically appearing as air elementals, djinn, or haoou (aerial servants). While their true form is nearly identical to an air elemental, subtle differences remain discernible. The sshai are sometimes employed by djinn and haoou as spies or guards, and in their own realm, they typically possess between 1 and 12 Hit Dice while remaining roughly man-sized. Although some may even wield spells, they generally prefer negotiation to combat and have few enemies—except for their notable apprehension toward earth-type creatures and attacks.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Any; Plane of Air</p>",

A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>.

They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table. Roll again if a type of creature has already responded that day.</p>\n<table style=\"width:300px\">\n    <tbody><tr><th><p>Roll</p></th><th><p>Creature</p></th></tr>\n<tr><td><p>1-5</p></td><td><p>Spectre ([[/r 2d4 #Spectre]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>6-9</p></td><td><p>Vampire ([[/r 1d6 #Vampire]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>10-12</p></td><td><p>Phantom, Shade ([[/r 1d3 #Phantom, Shade]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>13-15</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Ghost ([[/r 1d2 #Chaotic Haunt,Ghost]] Chaotic)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Poltergeist ([[/r 1d2 #Haunt, Poltergeist]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Druj</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Revenant</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Nightshade (any 1)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Undead Beholder</p></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A summoned vampire may have a [[/r 1d100 #Summoned vampire is a magic-user or cleric on 25 or less.

It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table. Roll again if a type of creature has already responded that day.</p>\n<table style=\"width:300px\">\n    <tbody><tr><th><p>Roll</p></th><th><p>Creature</p></th></tr>\n<tr><td><p>1-5</p></td><td><p>Spectre ([[/r 2d4 #Spectre]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>6-9</p></td><td><p>Vampire ([[/r 1d6 #Vampire]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>10-12</p></td><td><p>Phantom, Shade ([[/r 1d3 #Phantom, Shade]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>13-15</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Ghost ([[/r 1d2 #Chaotic Haunt,Ghost]] Chaotic)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Poltergeist ([[/r 1d2 #Haunt, Poltergeist]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Druj</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Revenant</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Nightshade (any 1)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Undead Beholder</p></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A summoned vampire may have a [[/r 1d100 #Summoned vampire is a magic-user or cleric on 25 or less.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table. Roll again if a type of creature has already responded that day.</p>\n<table style=\"width:300px\">\n    <tbody><tr><th><p>Roll</p></th><th><p>Creature</p></th></tr>\n<tr><td><p>1-5</p></td><td><p>Spectre ([[/r 2d4 #Spectre]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>6-9</p></td><td><p>Vampire ([[/r 1d6 #Vampire]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>10-12</p></td><td><p>Phantom, Shade ([[/r 1d3 #Phantom, Shade]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>13-15</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Ghost ([[/r 1d2 #Chaotic Haunt,Ghost]] Chaotic)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Poltergeist ([[/r 1d2 #Haunt, Poltergeist]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Druj</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Revenant</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Nightshade (any 1)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Undead Beholder</p></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A summoned vampire may have a [[/r 1d100 #Summoned vampire is a magic-user or cleric on 25 or less.

It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly.

The success of this attempt depends on the cleric’s level and the type of undead faced, as indicated on the Turning Undead table.</p><p>If the cleric succeeds, one or more undead creatures will flee or be destroyed immediately, depending on the result.

It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table. Roll again if a type of creature has already responded that day.</p>\n<table style=\"width:300px\">\n    <tbody><tr><th><p>Roll</p></th><th><p>Creature</p></th></tr>\n<tr><td><p>1-5</p></td><td><p>Spectre ([[/r 2d4 #Spectre]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>6-9</p></td><td><p>Vampire ([[/r 1d6 #Vampire]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>10-12</p></td><td><p>Phantom, Shade ([[/r 1d3 #Phantom, Shade]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>13-15</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Ghost ([[/r 1d2 #Chaotic Haunt,Ghost]] Chaotic)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Poltergeist ([[/r 1d2 #Haunt, Poltergeist]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Druj</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Revenant</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Nightshade (any 1)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Undead Beholder</p></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A summoned vampire may have a [[/r 1d100 #Summoned vampire is a magic-user or cleric on 25 or less.

This ability is known as <strong>Turn Undead</strong>. When encountering these undead beings, the cleric can choose to either engage them in combat with weapons or spells, or attempt to turn them.</p><p>To turn undead, the cleric simply announces the intention to do so to the Dungeon Master. No holy symbol or other item is needed unless the DM specifies otherwise. The success of this attempt depends on the cleric’s level and the type of undead faced, as indicated on the Turning Undead table.</p><p>If the cleric succeeds, one or more undead creatures will flee or be destroyed immediately, depending on the result. However, a failed attempt means that particular undead creature cannot be turned by the cleric again during the same encounter. Multiple attempts are allowed in future encounters.</p><p>Should the attempt succeed, the Dungeon Master rolls to determine how many Hit Dice worth of undead are turned. At least one undead creature will always be affected. A turned undead creature will retreat as far as possible, but it has not been destroyed and may return after some time.</p>",

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table. Roll again if a type of creature has already responded that day.</p>\n<table style=\"width:300px\">\n    <tbody><tr><th><p>Roll</p></th><th><p>Creature</p></th></tr>\n<tr><td><p>1-5</p></td><td><p>Spectre ([[/r 2d4 #Spectre]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>6-9</p></td><td><p>Vampire ([[/r 1d6 #Vampire]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>10-12</p></td><td><p>Phantom, Shade ([[/r 1d3 #Phantom, Shade]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>13-15</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Ghost ([[/r 1d2 #Chaotic Haunt,Ghost]] Chaotic)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Poltergeist ([[/r 1d2 #Haunt, Poltergeist]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Druj</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Revenant</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Nightshade (any 1)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Undead Beholder</p></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A summoned vampire may have a [[/r 1d100 #Summoned vampire is a magic-user or cleric on 25 or less.

A successful saving throw generally halves the damage or avoids the secondary effect (such as paralysis or petrification), while failure applies the full consequences. The target number for the saving throw is determined by the character’s class and level.</p>",

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table. Roll again if a type of creature has already responded that day.</p>\n<table style=\"width:300px\">\n    <tbody><tr><th><p>Roll</p></th><th><p>Creature</p></th></tr>\n<tr><td><p>1-5</p></td><td><p>Spectre ([[/r 2d4 #Spectre]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>6-9</p></td><td><p>Vampire ([[/r 1d6 #Vampire]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>10-12</p></td><td><p>Phantom, Shade ([[/r 1d3 #Phantom, Shade]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>13-15</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Ghost ([[/r 1d2 #Chaotic Haunt,Ghost]] Chaotic)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Poltergeist ([[/r 1d2 #Haunt, Poltergeist]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Druj</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Revenant</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Nightshade (any 1)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Undead Beholder</p></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A summoned vampire may have a [[/r 1d100 #Summoned vampire is a magic-user or cleric on 25 or less.

It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly.

When encountering these undead beings, the cleric can choose to either engage them in combat with weapons or spells, or attempt to turn them.</p><p>To turn undead, the cleric simply announces the intention to do so to the Dungeon Master. No holy symbol or other item is needed unless the DM specifies otherwise. The success of this attempt depends on the cleric’s level and the type of undead faced, as indicated on the Turning Undead table.</p><p>If the cleric succeeds, one or more undead creatures will flee or be destroyed immediately, depending on the result. However, a failed attempt means that particular undead creature cannot be turned by the cleric again during the same encounter. Multiple attempts are allowed in future encounters.</p><p>Should the attempt succeed, the Dungeon Master rolls to determine how many Hit Dice worth of undead are turned. At least one undead creature will always be affected. A turned undead creature will retreat as far as possible, but it has not been destroyed and may return after some time.</p>",

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table. Roll again if a type of creature has already responded that day.</p>\n<table style=\"width:300px\">\n    <tbody><tr><th><p>Roll</p></th><th><p>Creature</p></th></tr>\n<tr><td><p>1-5</p></td><td><p>Spectre ([[/r 2d4 #Spectre]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>6-9</p></td><td><p>Vampire ([[/r 1d6 #Vampire]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>10-12</p></td><td><p>Phantom, Shade ([[/r 1d3 #Phantom, Shade]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>13-15</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Ghost ([[/r 1d2 #Chaotic Haunt,Ghost]] Chaotic)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>Haunt, Poltergeist ([[/r 1d2 #Haunt, Poltergeist]])</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Druj</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Spirit, Revenant</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Nightshade (any 1)</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Undead Beholder</p></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>A summoned vampire may have a [[/r 1d100 #Summoned vampire is a magic-user or cleric on 25 or less.

A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>.

They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type).

It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table.

They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level.

Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly.

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine garments and was once an evil and chaotic magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often 27-36). A lich is still able to use spells as it did while alive, making it extremely dangerous. A lich is not normally found wandering but instead remains in or very near a well-defended lair, which might be a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\").</p>\n<p>The very sight of a lich causes fear in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw). Its mere touch causes [[/r 1d10 #Touch damage]] <strong>points of damage</strong> and can paralyze any creature for [[/r 1d100 #Paralyzed for this many days]] <strong>days</strong> (though a saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p><strong>Before any encounter with a lich, the DM should select spells for the creature with care, as a lich is extremely intelligent and uses them to its best advantage</strong>. Note that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich flees if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (but not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to <em>charm</em>, <em>sleep</em>, <em>feeblemind</em>, <em>polymorph</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>lightning</em>, and <em>death</em> spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. They are also immune to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level. Outside of its lair, a lich always carries [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Powerful items]] powerful magical items to be used in case of trouble. These should be chosen, not randomly determined. Within its lair, a lich has <strong>4d8</strong> additional temporary magical items (or more), plus the amounts of coins, gems, and jewelry given for Treasure Type H in Chapter 16 (with a 90% chance for each type). The number and severity of traps and other dangers to intruders should be appropriate to protect such a hoard.</p>\n<p>A magic-user lich normally has [[/r 1d2 #Spells]] <strong>spells</strong> of a permanent nature, most often detect invisible or fly. A clerical lich normally has [[/r 3d4 #Types of undead lairs nearby]] <strong>types</strong> of other undead nearby, acting as servants, with a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. The summons can be made simply by concentrating, and the creature(s) responding arrive [[/r 1d100 #rounds]] <strong>rounds</strong> later, depending on their distance. The summons may be made as often as desired, but any one type of creature will respond only once per day at most. To randomly determine the creatures appearing in response to the summons, roll [[/r 1d20 #See lich summon table for result]] and refer to the table.

The head is topped by large horns, and large fangs protrude from either side of the trunk. The chest is a mass of slimy, short tentacles. Long, muscular arms end in large, jagged pincers, and its feet are webbed and clawed. It is colored night-black but has red veins and eyes.</p><p>In combat, a malfera attacks with its pincers and bites. If both pincers hit the same target, the victim is dragged to the chest of the malfera on the next round. The tentacles then automatically trap the victim. These tentacles are coated with an acid slime and deal <strong>2d6 points of damage</strong> each round. The victim can be freed only when the malfera is killed.</p><p>In addition, the breath of a malfera is poisonous. Each time it hits with a bite, its victim must save vs. poison (at a +3 bonus) or die. A malfera is immune to acid and can be struck only by magical weapons.</p><p>Aside from its combat abilities, a malfera can detect invisible creatures and open all doors as if it had a knock spell.

Medusae are very magical, and the mere sight of a medusa will turn a creature to stone unless the victim makes a saving throw vs. turn to stone. However, this will affect only one character per round, and characters may watch the reflection of a medusa in a mirror without danger. If a medusa sees her own reflection, she must make a saving throw vs. turn to stone or she will petrify herself!</p><p>In combat, the medusa makes one attack roll for the bites of the snakes, and if they hit, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison (in addition to taking <strong>1d6 points of damage</strong>) or die in one turn. A medusa will often wear a robe with a hood for disguise so she can trick her victims into looking at her. Medusae occasionally use weapons.</p><p>Anyone who tries to attack a medusa without looking at her must subtract <strong>4</strong> from the attack roll, and the snakes may attack with a <strong>+2 bonus</strong> to the attack roll. A medusa also gains <strong>+2</strong> on all saving throws vs. spells due to her magical nature.</p><p>Many medusae are evil. Others are reclusive scholars, ancient sages who can guide heroes on their quests and who conceal their deadly visages under veils.</p><p>There are also medusa spellcasters (see \"Monster Spellcasters\").</p><p>Medusae are native to both the Prime Plane and their original home, the elemental plane of Earth.</p><p><strong>Plane of Earth:</strong> On the plane of Earth, a medusa is an ugly writhing mass of <strong>10-foot</strong> long tentacles connected to a small lumpy spherical body. Several eyes on foot-long eyestalks also protrude from the body; the mouth has many teeth. The tentacles are used both for movement (<strong>180' (60')</strong>) and combat. The medusa can attack with <strong>10 tentacles</strong> per round; each hit requires a saving throw vs. paralysis (lasting <strong>2d4 rounds</strong> if failed). A paralyzed victim is drawn to the mouth and bitten for <strong>2-16 (2d8)</strong> points of damage per round (no attack roll required while the victim is paralyzed).</p><p><strong>Elemental Plane of Earth Statistics:</strong> AC <strong>4</strong>, HD <strong>8**</strong>, MV <strong>180' (60')</strong>, NA <strong>1-4</strong>, Save <strong>F4</strong>, ML <strong>9</strong>, TT(V) <strong>F</strong>, AL <strong>C</strong>, XP <strong>1,750</strong>.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Cavern, Ruins; Plane of Earth.</p>",

      "biography": "<p>The Planar Spiders are intelligent, plane-traveling arachnids with an enigmatic civilization. They can move through planes and dimensions at will, often appearing from the Ethereal plane to attack and then 'shift' back. Most commonly encountered with 5 Hit Dice, leaders can have up to 12. Their home plane is described as a world covered with cities made of imperishable white webs, though no such cities have been found. These spiders speak Common and are not inherently hostile, capable of interactions similar to human NPCs. In combat, they gain automatic initiative when shifting planes, and there's a 75% chance they cannot be attacked before leaving unless the opponent is hasted. Their bite deals damage and requires a saving throw vs. poison at -4, or death, though they can choose to not use their poison. Planar spiders might carry 1d3 magical or 1d4 nonmagical but odd items. Rarely, some are spellcasters, either clerics or magic-users up to 9th level, with extra asterisks for XP calculation based on spellcasting ability. Spellcasting spiders cannot phase out in the same round they cast a spell.<br><b>Terrain:</b> Any</p>",

      "biography": "<p>Druj appear as body parts, floating or crawling about in a horrible way. A druj is usually encountered in the form of a hand, eye, or skull. Druj are very intelligent and strongly evil, far more dangerous than they may seem.</p><p>A druj can split its essence, creating four (identical) forms instead of one. This can be performed only once per night. Each of the forms can attack separately, but only one of the forms is able to cast spells (as given above). The form using the spells can often be distinguished, as it will hover nearby while the other forms attack. If that form is slain, one of the surviving forms immediately gains all unused spellcasting abilities. All four forms are poisonous.</p><p>If turned by a cleric, the parts of a druj turned are forced to reunite into one creature, remaining united for [[/r 1d4 + 1 #Rounds united]] rounds. Further success at turning is handled normally.</p><p>Druj are always encountered singly unless commanded into service by a lich or more powerful member of the Sphere of Death. In such cases, two druj eyes may rest within a druj skull, accompanied by two druj hands; no more than these five druj can ever gather in one place.</p><p><strong>Eye:</strong> An eye druj darts about, trying to touch (poison) its opponent; a touch does not inflict any damage other than poisoning. Each eye druj can also gaze at one victim per round (30' range), in addition to its physical attack. The victim must make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be paralyzed for [[/r 1d4 #Turns paralyzed]] turns. The eye druj may touch a paralyzed victim automatically.</p><p><strong>Hand:</strong> A hand druj inflicts [[/r 1d4 #Points of damage]] when it hits, and thereafter holds onto its victim, causing automatic damage each round thereafter. The damage caused is equal to the AC of the victim, ignoring dexterity and shield bonuses, plus [[/r 1d4 #Points]] each round. If the adjusted armor class is a negative number, the attack will still inflict [[/r 1d4 #Points of damage]] each round.</p><p><strong>Skull:</strong> A skull druj floats toward and bites its victim. When first approached, the victim must make a saving throw vs. spells or be frozen with fear, allowing the skull druj to bite (no attack roll needed) for [[/r 2d4 #Points of damage]]. The normal saving throw vs. poison applies to each bite.</p><h3>All Spirits</h3><p>Spirits are powerful evil beings inhabiting the bodies (or body parts) of others; they are among the nastiest of undead monsters. They are immune to spells below 4th level, and cannot be harmed by normal weapons or magical weapons of less than +2 enchantment.</p><p>All spirits are travelers, never staying in one place for more than one night; they become invisible and nearly powerless (except to move) with the light of dawn, regaining their powers at dusk. In daylight, any spirit can travel up to 24 miles per day (1 hex).</p><p>All spirits are poisonous. When hit by a spirit in hand-to-hand combat, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or die immediately. A new saving throw must be made for each hit by the spirit.</p><p>The poisonous presence of a spirit causes all consumable items within 30', including normal food and water, holy water, all rations (even iron) and even magical potions to become spoiled and useless (but not poisoned), with no saving throw allowed. Even living plants and small insects within this area are paralyzed, dying if the spirit remains there more than an hour. This effect negates all forms of plant control, insect swarms and plagues, both normal and magical.</p><p>All spirits can sense invisible things, and can attack them without penalty. All spirits can, once per round, at will, create the following cleric spell effects: <em>darkness</em>, <em>silence</em> 15' radius, <em>cause disease</em>, <em>animate dead</em>, <em>finger of death</em> (all as if cast by a 16th level cleric). A spirit will often pause to animate the body of a fallen victim, creating and controlling it as a zombie to fight for it and add to the chaos. (Attempts at turning such zombies are made as if turning the spirit itself!) All of these spell-like abilities require concentration, as do normal spells, so while using an ability, a spirit cannot attack physically. Unlike normal cleric spells, no words or gestures are needed.</p><p>A spirit normally has no treasure, though it may occasionally serve as a guard for some special item. Those characters who risk travel at night may encounter a spirit with 1d6 of its victims, who may carry treasure.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Any (usually Barren Lands and Ruins)</p>",

The plant can easily be seen at long range (up to 300 yards), as the odic radiates a purplish light in a 20' radius. Any living being within this light must make a saving throw vs. spells or lose 1 level because of energy drain (as if struck by a wight).</p><p>Once it has settled for the night, an odic cannot move from the spot until daybreak. While using its spells, it can attack by animating part of the plant. The longest branch or vine of the plant reaches out (10-30' range), attacking as a 16 HD monster and inflicting 1d12 points of damage per hit (in addition to poison).</p><p>The plant is immediately killed when the odic possesses it. The creature uses the plant's parts to seek out other life to feed on. Most commonly, it animates individual leaves, which float away (movement rate 30' per round) in search of victims; it can animate up to 6 such leaves at one time. The leaves may be seen up to 1 mile from the odic. Animated leaves normally gain surprise (90% chance). Each leaf attacks as if a 4 Hit Dice monster; no damage is inflicted, but each victim hit must make a saving throw vs. spells or be charmed. A charmed victim is drawn toward the odic and has a -4 penalty on the saving throw against the energy drain when entering the purple aura.</p><p>If the plant possessed has no detachable leaves, the odic may animate other portions (pine needles, flowers, etc.) in a similar manner, as described above—up to 6 at once, each with a charm ability per touch.</p><p>Odics occasionally inhabit the bodies of plantlike monsters. The creature may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the possession, but may die from the level draining and other abilities of the odic even if the saving throw is successful. The odic gains the abilities of any plantlike monster possessed. They may be used in addition to the normal abilities of the odic.</p><p>Odics are always encountered singly.</p><h3>All Spirits</h3><p>Spirits are powerful evil beings inhabiting the bodies (or body parts) of others; they are among the nastiest of undead monsters.

Tentacles sprout from its entire body. It has six eyes, positioned evenly about the surface of the body (top, bottom, front, back, sides). It normally keeps all but a few upper tentacles retracted.</p><p>A sporacle regenerates by submersing itself in fresh water (but not in brine) at the rate of 3 hit points per round so lost body parts may be rapidly regrown. If a loose tentacle falls or is placed in water, it will grow into a whole creature in 1 hour. This is their only method of reproduction, so they are often found near a water source.</p><p>A sporacle may attack anything, but prefers humanoids as food. As it moves into combat, it extends all its tentacles, appearing to sprout them as it attacks. It moves through air or water by magical flight, but is very quick. It spins rapidly in all directions when in combat, using all of its tentacles each round against 1 or 2 opponents. A sporacle has average intelligence (10) and cannot use spells or magical items.</p><p>The sporacle prefers not to bite victims that are still moving. It uses its tentacle attacks only until all have been destroyed; only then will it resort to its ferocious bite. Each tentacle hit inflicts 1 point of damage, and each requires a saving throw vs. paralysis. Failure indicates that the venomous tentacle has struck skin, and takes effect. This paralysis is a delayed sort, however, taking effect after 1 round passes; it lasts for 1 turn thereafter unless cured. If its opponents flee, it will remain to feast upon its paralyzed victims; if there are none, it always pursues.</p><p>The sporacle may be damaged by any sort of edged weapon, and by any missile weapon except a sling. However, it is immune to blunt weapons and to all spells and magical devices except those that cause damage; these will destroy one tentacle per die of damage (or per magic missile), not affecting the creature's hit points. Once all the tentacles are destroyed, such spells have no further effect. Sporacles cannot hear and are immune to all sound-based effects; they are also immune to poison, paralysis, and charms.</p><p>If any attacker declares the tentacles to be the target of the blow and wields an edged weapon, <strong>the tentacle is AC 4 and easily severed</strong>. After falling off, a tentacle will live for up to 1 hour, remaining venomous for that time. When the creature is reduced to 0 hit points or less, its body comes apart grotesquely, spinning wildly and sending all remaining tentacles in various directions. (Make final attack rolls as applicable.)</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Cavern</p>",

They can swim at an accelerated rate, forming a revolving coil for short bursts.</p><p>Undines are immune to poison, normal weapons, all 1st and 2nd level spells, and fire-based attacks. They can detect invisible creatures at will and use spells like detect magic, web, dispel magic, ice storm/wall, and fire to ice three times per day, as if cast by a 9th level magic-user. Their web, made of ice strands, functions like a normal web but melts harmlessly when exposed to flame.</p><p>An undine's attack involves shaping water into a 'fist' for melee combat or coiling around an opponent for constriction damage. On the Prime Plane, they resemble water elementals, becoming invisible in water and regenerating damage, but they take damage from drying out when not submerged. Unlike elementals, they are not limited by protection from evil or proximity to water.</p><p>Undines have natural enemies in the hydrax and hordes, and they are wary of air-type creatures and attacks.</p><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Plane of Water</p>",

They possess the chilling power to transform into a human guise, a dire wolf, a giant bat, or a cloud of gas, with each transformation requiring one round. No matter the form, vampires regenerate at a rate of 3 hit points per round once injured. Should their hit points reach zero, they turn into gas and escape to their coffins to heal.</p><p>In human form, a vampire can attack with a deadly touch that not only deals damage but also drains double the life energy of the victim, or use its gaze to enthrall opponents. The gaze requires a saving throw vs. spells at a -2 penalty to resist the charm.
