Covered in a brown, elklike hide, it can blend into forest environments as if invisible.</p><p>Actaeons react aggressively to the slaying of woodland creatures or other similar offenses. They often attack with large wooden or bone spears, appearing suddenly from hiding with a 1-5 chance on a 1d6 for surprise.</p><p>Once per day, an Actaeon can use a breath weapon that fills a 10' cube. Those caught must save vs. dragon breath or be polymorphed into a normal forest creature such as an owl, squirrel, or deer. A successful save results in a 24-hour transformation.</p><p>Actaeons are integral members of the woodland community, often found among creatures such as centaurs and dryads. Their rarity and bravery make them celebrated champions of the forest. They frequently collaborate with druids to safeguard the woodlands, particularly when a serious threat arises.</p><p>Some actaeons may possess spellcasting abilities.</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Forests.<br><strong>Carrying Capacity:</strong> 3,000 cn at full speed; 6,000 cn at half speed.</p>",

They inhabit hilly, mountainous, or wooded areas, living in small family units. When not hunting, they fight among themselves.</p>\n      <p>In combat, they bash opponents with heavy objects like tree stumps or stones, and their bite carries a potent poison. Victims of the bite must make a saving throw vs. poison with a -4 penalty or be rendered helpless for 1d6 turns.

Each djinni has seven unique powers that they can use three times per day:</p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Create food and drink (as a 7th-level cleric).</li>\n                  <li>Create metallic objects up to 1,000 cn in weight (temporary: gold lasts 1 day, iron lasts 1 round).</li>\n                  <li>Create soft goods and wooden objects up to 1,000 cn in weight (permanent).</li>\n                  <li>Become invisible.</li>\n                  <li>Assume gaseous form.</li>\n                  <li>Form a whirlwind.</li>\n                  <li>Create illusions affecting sight and hearing (lasts until touched or dispelled).</li>\n                </ul>\n                <p>A djinni can attack with a powerful fist or transform into a whirlwind that deals 2d6 damage to all in its path. The transformation takes five rounds, and the whirlwind can sweep away creatures with fewer than 2 HD unless they make a saving throw vs. death ray. If a djinni is slain, its spirit returns to its own plane.</p>\n                <p>Djinn dislike being enslaved by magic-users and view them with suspicion. On their own plane, they are immune to normal weapons, all 1st-level spells, and attacks based on water. They can also detect invisible creatures at will.</p>\n                <p>**Terrain:** Plane of Air, Desert (preferred).</p>\n                <p>**Load:** A djinni can carry 3,500 cn of weight at full speed or 7,000 cn at half speed. In times of great need, it can carry up to 12,000 cn for a short duration but must rest afterward.</p>",

Often encountered near volcanoes, deep in dungeons, or among other fire-loving beings such as fire giants, it is both cunning and highly intelligent.</p>\n<p>Hellhounds can detect invisible foes (using a method akin to the magic-user spell) with a 75% chance per round within a 60-foot range. They are immune to normal fire and make all saving throws as fighters of equivalent Hit Dice.</p>\n<p>In combat, a hellhound targets a single opponent each round, choosing either a biting attack that inflicts 1d6 damage or a fire breath attack. The fire breath deals 1d6 points of damage for each Hit Die of the hellhound; the attack is triggered on a roll of 1–2 on a 1d6 (a one-in-three chance), while the bite occurs on a roll of 3–6 (a two-in-three chance). A target struck by the fire breath may attempt a saving throw versus dragon breath to halve the damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Cavern, Mountain</p>\n<p><strong>Load:</strong> 3500 (half speed load)</p>\n<p><strong>Barding Multiplier:</strong> x2</p>",

Unarmored characters or monsters with AC 6 or worse take 4 points of damage per round.</p><p>A victim who takes the time to swat at the insects (using a weapon or torch) instead of attacking or performing another action takes only 1 point of damage per round. Characters trying to swat with their hands or arms are ineffective.</p><p>If a swarm is attacked, it will relentlessly pursue its attacker. Victims can escape by disappearing from sight (such as with invisibility, moving around a corner, etc.) or by diving underwater, which kills all the insects after one round (normal damage applies during this round).</p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Any (except Arctic)</p>",

When given a clear and straightforward command, it obeys without hesitation; however, if the assignment is ambiguous or prolonged, it may twist the intent while following the literal wording—for example, guarding a treasure for over a week might result in it transporting the treasure back to its native plane to guard indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Primarily employed to track and eliminate foes, this creature is not only highly intelligent but also an impeccable tracker. Should a target be unable to detect invisible entities, the stalker will launch a surprise attack on a roll of 1-5 (on [/r 1d6 #roll]). Conversely, any creature capable of perceiving invisibility gains a +4 bonus when attacking it. Once its mission is complete, or if it is slain or dispelled, the stalker promptly returns to its home plane.</p>\n<p>The term \"invisible stalkers\" is the human designation for this species, though they call themselves the <em>sshai</em>. Native to the elemental plane of Air, the sshai move with exceptional speed on their home plane—reaching 360' (120'). There, they resemble dopplegangers, possessing the ability to use ESP at will and to shapechange into nearly any form native to that plane, typically appearing as air elementals, djinn, or haoou (aerial servants). While their true form is nearly identical to an air elemental, subtle differences remain discernible. The sshai are sometimes employed by djinn and haoou as spies or guards, and in their own realm, they typically possess between 1 and 12 Hit Dice while remaining roughly man-sized. Although some may even wield spells, they generally prefer negotiation to combat and have few enemies—except for their notable apprehension toward earth-type creatures and attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Any; Plane of Air</p>",

It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 21 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid.

It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 22 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day.

The player rolls a d20 and compares it to their class- and level-specific target number on the saving throw table; success means avoiding or mitigating the harm. A failed roll often results in death (for poison) or other severe consequences, though optional rules may instead inflict substantial damage​​​.</p>",

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin from the game. It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 24 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 25 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

This includes attacks like a dragon’s fiery or icy breath, a gorgon's petrifying breath, or a chimera's elemental breath. Each creature’s breath weapon has specific effects, such as damage, paralysis, or petrification. A successful saving throw generally halves the damage or avoids the secondary effect (such as paralysis or petrification), while failure applies the full consequences. The target number for the saving throw is determined by the character’s class and level.</p>",

It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 27 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day.

When encountering these undead beings, the cleric can choose to either engage them in combat with weapons or spells, or attempt to turn them.</p><p>To turn undead, the cleric simply announces the intention to do so to the Dungeon Master. No holy symbol or other item is needed unless the DM specifies otherwise. The success of this attempt depends on the cleric’s level and the type of undead faced, as indicated on the Turning Undead table.</p><p>If the cleric succeeds, one or more undead creatures will flee or be destroyed immediately, depending on the result. However, a failed attempt means that particular undead creature cannot be turned by the cleric again during the same encounter. Multiple attempts are allowed in future encounters.</p><p>Should the attempt succeed, the Dungeon Master rolls to determine how many Hit Dice worth of undead are turned. At least one undead creature will always be affected. A turned undead creature will retreat as far as possible, but it has not been destroyed and may return after some time.</p>",

      "biography": "<p>A lich is a powerful undead monster of magical origin from the game. It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 29 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 30 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day.

It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 31 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

When encountering these undead beings, the cleric can choose to either engage them in combat with weapons or spells, or attempt to turn them.</p><p>To turn undead, the cleric simply announces the intention to do so to the Dungeon Master. No holy symbol or other item is needed unless the DM specifies otherwise. The success of this attempt depends on the cleric’s level and the type of undead faced, as indicated on the Turning Undead table.</p><p>If the cleric succeeds, one or more undead creatures will flee or be destroyed immediately, depending on the result. However, a failed attempt means that particular undead creature cannot be turned by the cleric again during the same encounter. Multiple attempts are allowed in future encounters.</p><p>Should the attempt succeed, the Dungeon Master rolls to determine how many Hit Dice worth of undead are turned. At least one undead creature will always be affected. A turned undead creature will retreat as far as possible, but it has not been destroyed and may return after some time.</p>",

Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day.

It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 33 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

It appears as a skeleton clad in fine garments and was once an evil, chaotic cleric of level 35 (levels often range from 27 to 36). Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid. To do so, the lich concentrates and the summoned creature(s) arrive 1d100 rounds later based on their distance. Summoning can be performed as often as desired, but each creature type will respond only once per day. To determine which creature is summoned, roll 1d20:<br>\nRoll 1-5: Spectre (2d4)<br>\nRoll 6-9: Vampire (1d6)<br>\nRoll 10-12: Phantom, Shade (1d3)<br>\nRoll 13-15: Haunt, Ghost (1d2 Chaotic)<br>\nRoll 16: Haunt, Poltergeist (1d2)<br>\nRoll 17: Spirit, Druj<br>\nRoll 18: Spirit, Revenant<br>\nRoll 19: Nightshade (any 1)<br>\nRoll 20: Undead Beholder</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ruins</p>",

Retaining its spellcasting prowess from life, this lich remains an extremely dangerous adversary.</p>\n<p>It is not typically encountered wandering, but is found in or near a well-defended lair such as a dungeon, catacomb, tomb, or necropolis (\"city of the dead\"). The mere sight of a lich instills terror in all characters below 5th level (no saving throw applies), while its touch inflicts 1d10 points of damage and may paralyze a target for 1d100 days (saving throw applies, and the paralysis is magically dispellable).</p>\n<p>Prior to any encounter, the game master should carefully select spells for the lich given its formidable intelligence. Although its morale is listed as 10, a lich will flee if in actual danger.</p>\n<p>Liches are undead and can be turned (though not destroyed) by clerics. They are immune to charm, sleep, feeblemind, polymorph, cold, lightning, and death spells, and can be harmed only by magical weapons. Additionally, they are immune to all spells of less than 4th level.</p>\n<p>Outside its lair, a lich carries 1d4+1 powerful magical items for emergencies, while within its lair it possesses 4d8 additional temporary magical items (or more). A clerical lich typically has 3d4 types of other undead nearby, acting as servants – a full lair of each type (maximum number appearing) is usually present.</p>\n<p>Either type of lich can summon other powerful undead for aid.

It has ten small eyes on stalks atop its body, each with its own unique magical power, and a large central eye positioned on the front, with a toothy mouth below.</p><p>The Orb Guardian moves by means of a slow, natural flight that cannot be dispelled. It is highly intelligent, cruel, and greedy, and speaks many languages. This creature is typically found alone but may be accompanied by 1d6 young (each with 1/10 normal Hit Dice and eye effects, dealing 1d4 points of bite damage) with a 5% chance.</p><p>The central eye of an Orb Guardian emits an anti-magic ray, which negates all magical effects within 60 feet in front of it. Magical weapons in this area are treated as non-magical, and spells cast within the area of effect are instantly disrupted. Spells cast from outside the area are ruined when they enter its range. The Orb Guardian will turn to face any character who begins spellcasting, disrupting the spell. Once the anti-magic ray is no longer directed at an object or area, magical items and effects return to their normal function.</p><p>The anti-magic ray cannot be directed above or below the creature, only straight ahead. As the ray can negate any magic, even that of the smaller eyes, the Orb Guardian cannot use its smaller eye powers on targets within this area.</p><p>When attacking an Orb Guardian, players must declare whether they are aiming at the body, the large central eye, or an eye stalk, each with distinct armor class and hit points:</p><ul><li>The body has AC 0 and 50 hit points.</li><li>The central eye has AC 2 and 20 hit points.</li><li>An eye stalk has AC 7 and can withstand 12 hit points of damage. Damage to eye stalks does not contribute to killing the creature.</li></ul><p><strong>Small Eyes and Eyestalks:</strong> If an attack hits an eye stalk, the GM should randomly determine which stalk is damaged. A severed eye stalk is rendered nonfunctional, but partial damage does not impede its operation. Lost eyes regenerate in 2d4 days, and partially damaged stalks heal at a rate of 1 hit point per day.</p><p>The Orb Guardian can only direct four small eyes in one direction at a time and cannot target directly beneath its body. Each eye can fire a ray with a different spell-like effect once per round. The spell effects are detailed below, with reversed versions indicated by an asterisk.</p><p><strong>Eye Powers:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Charm Person</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Charm Monster</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Sleep</strong> (range 240')</li><li><strong>Telekinesis</strong> (range 120', up to 5,000 cn weight)</li><li><strong>Flesh to Stone</strong>* (range 120')</li><li><strong>Disintegrate</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Cause Fear</strong>* (range 120')</li><li><strong>Slow</strong>* (range 240')</li><li><strong>Cause Serious Wounds</strong>* (range 60')</li><li><strong>Death Spell</strong> (range 240')</li></ol><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Caverns, Ruins.</p>",

      "biography": "<p>An Undead Orb Guardian is similar in appearance to its living counterpart but is actually a construct created for a specific malevolent purpose. These creatures are never naturally undead; instead, they are crafted for dark deeds. The Undead Orb Guardian resembles a large floating sphere, about four feet in diameter, covered with tough, armor-plated skin. It has ten small eyes on stalks, each capable of a different magical effect, and a large central eye on the front of its body with a toothy mouth below. The creature moves using natural (non-magical) flight, and it is highly intelligent, capable of speaking many languages. A cleric of 25th level or higher can recognize it as an undead being upon sight.</p><p>Undead Orb Guardians are immune to normal, silver, and even +1 magical weapons; only a magical weapon of +2 or greater can harm them. They are unaffected by charm, hold, and sleep spells, as well as illusions, death rays, and poison. Their bodies regenerate 3 hit points per round once damaged. If reduced to 0 hit points, they shift into gaseous form and cannot regenerate until resting for 1 hour in complete darkness, after which their regeneration resumes. They often maintain areas of continual darkness around their lairs.</p><p>These creatures can assume gaseous form at will. In this state, they lose access to their special abilities but cannot be harmed except by magic that affects air. Their bite inflicts 2d10 points of damage and causes a two-level energy drain, similar to that of a vampire.</p><p>The central eye of an Undead Orb Guardian projects a ray of reflection, bouncing any spell cast at it back to the caster. Similarly, any attempt to turn undead from this direction reflects back onto the cleric, who must succeed in a saving throw vs. spells or flee in terror for 2d6 rounds. The creature will typically turn to face any spellcasting character to utilize this defense. This reflective ray only works in the front arc and cannot be directed above or behind the creature.</p><p>When attacking, the player must specify whether they are targeting the body, the large eye, or an eye stalk. Each part has different armor classes and hit points:</p><ul><li>The body has AC -4 and 90 hit points.</li><li>The central eye has AC -2 and 30 hit points.</li><li>Each eye stalk has AC 3 and can withstand 20 hit points of damage. Damage to the eye stalks does not count toward destroying the creature.</li></ul><p>Small eyes and eyestalks: Each small eye can be used once per round, and only three eyes can focus in one direction (forward, backward, etc.). If the target is above the creature, all ten eyes can be used. The Undead Orb Guardian often uses only two eyes per round unless it perceives a serious threat. If an eye is destroyed, it can regrow in 1d4 + 1 hours, although this regeneration is slower than that of the body.</p><p><strong>Eye Powers:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Animate Dead</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Charm</strong> (as vampire, 120' range, with a -2 penalty to the saving throw)</li><li><strong>Continual Darkness</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Death Spell</strong> (range 120')</li><li><strong>Energy Drain</strong> (1 level, as wight)</li><li><strong>Energy Drain</strong> (2 levels, as spectre)</li><li><strong>Paralysis</strong> (as ghoul, range 60'; elves are immune to this ray)</li><li><strong>Animate Object</strong> (range 60')</li><li><strong>Dispel Magic</strong> (26th level)</li><li><strong>Telekinesis</strong> (4,000 cn)</li></ol><p><strong>Terrain:</strong> Cavern, Ruins.</p>",

A successful save limits the damage to 2d6, but failure initiates a gradual fading process, turning the victim translucent like the hound over 24 hours. The victim's equipment remains unaffected, but once fully faded, they cannot hold normal items, hear, or speak to unfaded beings, perceiving normal things as translucent while faded entities appear solid. A dimension door spell can restore a faded character to normal at any time by allowing them to step through it.

Chaotic sphinxes might be very territorial. Both male and female sphinxes are extremely intelligent spellcasters; the female acts as a 12th-level cleric, the male as a 12th-level magic-user, with all saves against their spells at a -4 penalty. In combat, they use claws, bites, or spells, but their roar is their most formidable attack, usable twice per day. This roar affects all within 120 feet, forcing a save vs. spells at -4 or flee in fear for 1d6 turns. Within 60 feet, victims also face paralysis, being stunned for 1-6 rounds if they fail another save. Within 10 feet, the effects include fear, stun, 6d6 damage, and deafness for 1d10 turns without a save. Sphinxes are immune to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-level spells and nonmagical weapons. They enjoy puzzles, riddles, and trivia; solving these can avoid combat or gain friendship. When more than one sphinx is encountered, they are either a mated pair or with cubs.<br><b>Terrain:</b> Any; especially Desert<br><b>Load:</b> 6,000 cn at full speed; 12,000 cn at half speed.<br><b>Barding Multiplier:</b> x3</p>",

Their home plane is described as a world covered with cities made of imperishable white webs, though no such cities have been found. These spiders speak Common and are not inherently hostile, capable of interactions similar to human NPCs. In combat, they gain automatic initiative when shifting planes, and there's a 75% chance they cannot be attacked before leaving unless the opponent is hasted. Their bite deals damage and requires a saving throw vs. poison at -4, or death, though they can choose to not use their poison. Planar spiders might carry 1d3 magical or 1d4 nonmagical but odd items. Rarely, some are spellcasters, either clerics or magic-users up to 9th level, with extra asterisks for XP calculation based on spellcasting ability.

They are very intelligent and strongly evil, often more dangerous than they appear. Druj can split into four identical forms once per night, each poisonous and capable of attacking separately, with one form maintaining spell-like abilities. These abilities mimic cleric spells like darkness, silence 15' radius, cause disease, animate dead, and finger of death, cast as if by a 16th-level cleric, requiring concentration. Druj poison their victims on touch, causing immediate death if a saving throw vs. poison fails. Their presence spoils all consumable items within 30 feet, including normal food, water, holy water, rations, and magical potions, without allowing a saving throw, paralyzing plants and small insects, leading to their death if the spirit remains for over an hour. Druj can sense invisible things and attack them without penalty. They become invisible and nearly powerless at dawn, regaining powers at dusk, capable of traveling up to 24 miles per day in daylight.<br><b>Eye:</b> An eye druj darts to touch and poison its opponent without dealing damage, can gaze once per round to paralyze for 1d4 turns within 30 feet, automatically touching paralyzed victims.<br><b>Hand:</b> A hand druj inflicts 1d4 damage on hit, then holds on, causing damage each round equal to the victim's AC (ignoring dexterity and shield bonuses) plus 1d4; negative AC still causes 1d4 damage per round.<br><b>Skull:</b> A skull druj floats to bite, causing a save vs. spells or be frozen with fear, allowing automatic bites for 2d4 damage, with each bite requiring a save vs. poison.<br>The first successful turn attempt forces a druj's components to reunite for 1d4 + 1 rounds, after which further turning is handled normally. Druj are encountered singly unless commanded by a lich or higher Sphere of Death entity, where they might appear with other druj parts.<br><b>Terrain:</b> Any (usually Barren Lands and Ruins)</p>",

The bite is only used once all tentacles are destroyed, dealing 2d10 damage. The sporacle spins rapidly in combat, using all tentacles each round against one or two opponents. It cannot use spells or magical items and is of average intelligence (10).<br>The creature is immune to blunt weapons, sound-based effects, poison, paralysis, and charms. It can be damaged by edged or missile weapons (except slings); spells that cause damage affect only its tentacles, destroying one tentacle per die of damage.

Their web, made of ice strands, functions like a normal web but melts harmlessly when exposed to flame.<br>An undine's attack involves shaping water into a 'fist' for melee combat or coiling around an opponent for constriction damage. On the Prime Plane, they resemble water elementals, becoming invisible in water and regenerating damage, but they take damage from drying out when not submerged.

These creatures are known for their ability to transform shape, their supernatural resilience, and their capacity to drain life force.<br>Vampires are immune to spells like sleep, charm, and hold, and can only be harmed by magical weaponry. They possess the chilling power to transform into a human guise, a dire wolf, a giant bat, or a cloud of gas, with each transformation requiring one round. No matter the form, vampires regenerate at a rate of 3 hit points per round once injured. Should their hit points reach zero, they turn into gas and escape to their coffins to heal.<br>In human form, a vampire can attack with a deadly touch that not only deals damage but also drains double the life energy of the victim, or use its gaze to enthrall opponents. The gaze requires a saving throw vs. spells at a -2 penalty to resist the charm. Additionally, a vampire can call forth allies within 300 feet (or 300 yards outdoors) including swarms of rats, bats, or packs of dire wolves.<br>A human killed by a vampire rises as one themselves three days later, under the control of their creator. Vampires can also be spellcasters.<br><b>Weaknesses:</b> They are repelled by strongly presented holy symbols, cannot approach garlic without making a saving throw vs. poison, and are unable to cross running water except at bridges or within their coffins. During daylight, they must rest in their coffins or lose hit points, which won't regenerate until they've rested for a full day. Vampires cast no reflection, thus they shun mirrors. They can be destroyed by a wooden stake through the heart or by prolonged exposure to running water. In sunlight, they must save vs. death ray each round or disintegrate; however, a continual light spell does not have this effect. If all their resting places are blessed or destroyed, they weaken, losing hit points until they perish.<br><b>Terrain:</b> Ruins, Tombs, Crypts</p>",
